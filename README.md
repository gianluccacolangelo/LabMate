Every day a new paper comes out. A new finding that would enlight my research.
But reading papers takes time, a considerable amount of it. Even more, choosing
the right paper to read is not obvious. This is a problem, at least for me.
I love reading, I love it that much that I want to read everything.

But I can't.

So I made this.

This is a tool that emails me when a paper that might be relevant to my research
has been published. It uses LLMs to decide whether a paper might be relevant to
me based on my interests and on paper's abstract.
