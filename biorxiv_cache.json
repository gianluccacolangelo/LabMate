The molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells coopt neighboring adipocytes, however, remain elusive. Here, we describe a direct interaction linking tumorigenesis to adjacent adipocytes. We examine breast tumors and their normal adjacent tissue from several patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse models, and find that lipolysis and lipolytic signaling are activated in neighboring adipose tissue. We find that functional gap junctions form between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. As a result, cAMP is transferred from breast cancer cells to adipocytes and activates lipolysis in a gap junction-dependent manner. We identify connexin 31 (GJB3), which promotes receptor triple negative breast cancer growth and activation of lipolysis in vivo. Thus, direct tumor cell-adipocyte interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and may serve as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/314658", "title": "A miRNA screen identifies a transcriptional program controlling the fate of adult stem cell", "authors": "Robert, J.; Vlachavas, E.-I.; Lemaitre, G.; Chatziioannou, A.; Puceat, M.; Delom, F.; Fessart, D.", "author_corresponding": "Delphine  Fessart", "author_corresponding_institution": "Univ. of Bordeaux", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "5", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "cell biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/314658.source.xml", "abstract": "The 3D cultures provide more insight into cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions, better mimicking the environment where stem cells reside compared to traditional 2D cultures.

Cul3 engages dozens of adaptor proteins to recruit hundreds of substrates for ubiquitination, but the adaptors that impact sleep and synapses remain ill-defined. Here we implicate Insomniac (Inc), a conserved protein required for normal sleep and synaptic homeostasis in Drosophila, as a Cul3 adaptor. Inc binds Cul3 in vivo, and mutations within the N-terminal BTB domain of Inc that weaken Inc-Cul3 associations impair Inc activity, indicating that Inc function requires binding to the Cul3 complex. Deletion of the conserved C-terminus of Inc does not alter Cul3 binding but abolishes Inc activity in the context of sleep and synaptic homeostasis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of Inc is a substrate recruitment domain. Mutation of a conserved, disease-associated arginine in the Inc C-terminus also abolishes Inc function, suggesting that this residue is vital for recruiting Inc targets. Inc levels are negatively regulated by Cul3 in neurons, consistent with Inc degradation by autocatalytic ubiquitination, a hallmark of Cullin adaptors. These findings link Inc and Cul3 in vivo and indicate that Cul3-Inc complexes are essential for normal sleep and synaptic function.

Metabolic disorders are prevalent in women with breast cancer, increasing mortality and cancer recurrence rates. Despite clinical implications, the cause of breast cancerassociated metabolic dysfunction remains poorly understood. Skeletal muscle is crucial for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, thus key to whole-body glucose homeostasis. In this study, we determined the effect of breast cancer cell-conditioned media on skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to insulin. Method. L6 myotubes overexpressing myc-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4myc-L6) were incubated with 40% conditioned media from tumorigenic MCF7 or BT474, or non-tumorigenic control MCF10A breast cells. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics was applied to detect molecular rewiring in response to breast cancer in the muscle. Expression of myogenesis and inflammation markers, GLUT4 translocation, [3H]-2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake, and intramyocellular insulin signalling were determined. Results. Breast cancer cell-conditioned media induced proteomic changes in pathways related to sarcomere organisation, actin filament binding, and vesicle trafficking, disrupted myogenic differentiation, activated an inflammatory response via NF-{kappa}B, and induced muscle atrophy. Basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and 2DG uptake were reduced in myotubes treated with breast cancer cell-conditioned media compared to the control. Insulin signalling via the Rho GTPase Rac1 was blocked in breast cancer-treated myotubes, while Akt-TBC1D4 signalling was unaffected. Conclusion. Conditioned media from MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake via inhibition of GLUT4 translocation and intramyocellular insulin signalling by selectively blocking Rac1 activation and inducing inflammation. These findings indicate that the rewiring of skeletal muscle proteome, inflammation, and insulin signalling could play a role in metabolic dysfunction in patients with breast cancer.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2020.10.21.349050", "title": "An H3-K9-me-independent binding of Swi6/HP1 to siRNA-DNA hybrids initiates heterochromatin assembly at cognate dg-dh repeats in Fission Yeast", "authors": "Singh, J.; Kumar, J.; Haldar, S.; Gupta, N.; Kumar, V.; Thakur, M.; Chandradoss, K.

Subsequent self-association of Swi6/HP1 on adjacent nucleosomes or a cooperative interaction between Clr4 and Swi6/HP1 leads to folded heterochromatin structure. HP1 binding to RNA is shown to facilitate its localization at and assembly of heterochromatin in metazoans. Likewise, recruitment of Swi6/HP1 to centromere depends on the RNAi pathway in fission yeast; paradoxically, Swi6/HP1 is also thought to play a role in RNA turnover. Here we provide evidence in support of RNAi-independent recruitment of Swi6. We show that, apart from the low affinity binding to RNAs through its hinge domain, as already reported, Swi6/HP1 displays a hierarchy of increasing binding affinity through its chromodomain to the siRNAs corresponding to specific dg-dh repeats and even stronger binding to the cognate siRNA-DNA hybrids than to the siRNA precursors or general RNAs. Our results support a mechanism of recruitment of Swi6, which is dependent on its specific and high affinity binding to siRNA-DNA hybrid at the dg-dh repeats. This binding, which is independent of, albeit augmented by binding to H3- K9-Me2, leads to heterochromatin formation and silencing. We suggest that the net role of Swi6 in RNA physiology may be regulated by a balance between abundance and affinity of Swi6 towards heterochromatic and euchromatic RNAs and siRNAs.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.07.03.450642", "title": "Deep learning and cross-species analysis identify the influences of sex and cannabinoidsignaling on cerebellar vermis morphology", "authors": "Black, K.

Host cell remodeling depends on the export of different classes of exported parasite proteins into the infected red blood cell (RBC). Here we show that members of a recently discovered group of difficult to predict exported proteins harbor an N-terminal export domain, similar to other classes of exported proteins, indicating that this is a common theme among all classes of exported proteins. For one such protein, MSRP6 (MSP-7 related protein 6), we identified a second, untypical export-mediating domain that corresponded to its MSP7-like region. In addition to its function in export, this domain also mediated attachment to the Maurers clefts, prominent parasite-induced structures in the host cell where MSRP6 is located. Using BioID with the Maurers clefts attachment domain of MSRP6 to identify interactors and compartment neighbors in live parasites we discovered a novel complex of proteins at the Maurers clefts. We show that this complex is necessary for the anchoring and maintaining the structural integrity of the Maurers clefts. The Maurers clefts are believed to be involved in the transport of the major virulence factor PfEMP1 to the host cell surface where it mediates cytoadherence of infected RBCs to endothelial cells, a main reason for the importance of host cell modifications for parasite virulence in the human host. Taking advantage of MSRP6 complex mutants and IT4 parasites that we modified to express only one specific PfEMP1 we find that abolishing Maurers clefts anchoring was neither needed for PfEMP1 transport to the host cell surface nor for cytoadherence. Altogether, this work reveals parasite proteins involved in Maurers clefts anchoring and maintenance and unexpectedly finds that these functions seem to be dispensable for virulence factor transport and surface display.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.12.19.473323", "title": "Genome organization by SATB1 binding to base-unpairing regions (BURs) provides scaffold for SATB1-regulated gene expression", "authors": "Kohwi, Y.; Wong, X.; Grange, M.; Sexton, T.; Richards, H.

We uncovered that the nuclear protein SATB1 establishes two-tiered chromatin organization, one through indirect binding and another by direct binding of base-unpairing regions (BURs), which are genomic elements with high unwinding propensities. Published ChIP-seq datasets show SATB1 binding to highly accessible chromatin at enhancers and CTCF sites, but not to BURs. By employing urea ChIP-seq, which retains only directly bound protein:DNA complexes, we found that BURs, but not CTCF sites, are direct SATB1 binding targets. SATB1-bound BUR interactions with accessible chromatin can cross multiple topologically associated domains (TADs) and SATB1 is required for these megabase-scale interactions linked to cell type-specific gene expression. BURs are mainly found within lamina associated domains (LADs) sequestered at the nuclear lamina, but also in inter-LADs, and SATB1 binds a subset of BURs depending on cell type. Notably, despite the mutually exclusive SATB1-binding profiles uncovered by the two ChIP-seq methods, we found most peaks in both profiles are real and require SATB1. Together, we propose that SATB1 has functionally distinct modes of chromatin interaction by directly binding BURs to form a chromatin scaffold to which it indirectly tethers open chromatin.

We observe diverse task-related responses, either localized to branches or widespread throughout the apical tuft. However, even in expert mice, the tufts' capability to discriminate go/no-go stimuli remains poor. Yet, we identify two prevailing response types in dendritic branches: 1) responses to unexpected outcome (reward) in naive mice that decrease with growing task proficiency, and 2) responses associated with salient sensory stimuli, especially the outcome-predicting texture touch, that strengthen upon learning. We demonstrate that these response types match distinct unsigned components of the temporal difference error5 by replicating our results with a reinforcement learning model. Moreover, optogenetic apical inhibition of L5 neurons during the outcome time window prevents naive animals from learning the task, consistent with the effect of equivalent model perturbation.

In the past decades, game-theoretical models have helped to understand cancer, its response to various treatments, and to design better therapies. However, to fully utilize the potential of game-theoretical modelling in designing better anti-cancer therapies, we need more information on cancer population (ecological) and strategy (evolutionary) dynamics in response to treatment. Here we explore how transcriptomics data can be utilized as inputs of game-theoretic models for predicting evolutionary response to irradiation using patient-derived glioblastoma organoids. For that purpose, we utilize both supervised and unsupervised methods to disentangle cell mixtures from publicly available datasets and identify proportions of relevant cancer cell types in patient-derived glioblastoma organoids treated with radiotherapy. We then fit these proportions to the replicator dynamics, the most classic evolutionary game dynamics, to predict both transient evolutionary dynamics and evolutionary stable cell proportions in these organoids. Hereby we demonstrate a methodology that can be utilized to design evolutionary therapies, i.e. therapies that anticipate and prevent evolution of therapy resistance in cancer cells. Our predictions in glioblastoma suggest that hypoxia is the most important factor in identifying short-term response to irradiation, while this seems much less relevant for the long-term response. Further, we conclude that supervised methods are the best way to estimate cancer evolutionary dynamics when therapy resistance is a qualitative evolutionary trait. We provide a pipeline for designing better therapies through testing evolutionary responses in patient-derived organoids, while in parallel the ecological response can be tracked through serum biomarkers and imaging in the corresponding patients.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.03.09.483541", "title": "Odors drive feeding through gustatory receptor neurons in Drosophila", "authors": "Wei, H.-p.; Lam, T.

The grandmother hypothesis and its variation the live long hypothesis are untenable; the former requires climbing a steep fitness hill, as grandmothers share only 25% of their genes with their grandchildren, compared to 50% with their direct offspring, while the latter proposes a prolongation of the post-menopausal lifespan through selection, which is impossible in a population of non-reproducing females. The mate choice theory explains menopause as the result of asymmetric mating involving younger females and older males that leads to an accumulation of infertility mutations and the evolution of menopause in older females. In this study, we investigated the mate choice theory using an infertility mutation accumulation experiment with Drosophila melanogaster that involved mating between individuals of different age groups. After 70 generations of asymmetric mating, the results showed that younger females who were paired with older males showed declining fertility in old age. The same trend was noted with younger males when mated with older females; the fertility of the males declined in old age. These results support the mate choice theory and indicate that menopause is not a life history trait of females but of the sex of the younger mate. Mate choice theory treats the evolution of menopause and post-menopausal lifespan as independent traits that are driven by the mate choices exercised by older males.

Here, we propose a mechanistic model in which dendrite growth and the organization of synapses arise from the interaction of activity-independent cues from potential synaptic partners and local activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Consistent with experiments, three phases of dendritic growth -- overshoot, pruning, and stabilization -- emerge naturally in the model. The model generates stellate-like dendritic morphologies that capture several morphological features of biological neurons under normal and perturbed learning rules, reflecting biological variability. Model-generated dendrites have approximately optimal wiring length consistent with experimental measurements. In addition to establishing dendritic morphologies, activity-dependent plasticity rules organize synapses into spatial clusters according to the correlated activity they experience. We demonstrate that a trade-off between activity-dependent and -independent factors influences dendritic growth and synaptic location throughout development, suggesting that early developmental variability can affect mature morphology and synaptic function. Therefore, a single mechanistic model can capture dendritic growth and account for the synaptic organization of correlated inputs during development.

However, current EWAS are underpowered for biomarker detection and increasing sample sizes will require substantial resources. Therefore, alternative approaches for identifying candidate biomarkers through EWAS are critical for moving the field forward.\n\nObjectivesTo provide proof-of-principle that maximizing exposure variance in EWAS by selecting participants from disproportionately exposed global populations enables effective candidate biomarker detection, even in small sample sizes.\n\nMethodsWe profiled genome-wide DNA methylation using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in whole blood from N=32 individuals from Madre de Dios, Peru with high methylmercury (MeHg) exposure due to artisanal and small-scale gold mining. We compared DNA methylation in N=16 individuals with high (>10 g/g) vs. N=16 individuals with low (<1 g/g) total hair mercury (a proxy for methylmercury exposure), matched on age and sex.\n\nResultsWe identified nine differentially methylated CpG sites (FDR<0.05), including several with known links to MeHg toxicity. The most significantly different CpG site was in an intronic enhancer of the SLC5A7 gene, which encodes the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) that facilitates MeHg transport into protein-rich tissue, including muscle and brain. Our Gene Ontology and transcription factor motif enrichment analyses identified differential methylation of genes involved in several outcomes with established links to MeHg, including immune response, neurotoxicity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Last, we identified candidate epigenetic biomarkers of PUFA-mediated protection against MeHg toxicity.\n\nDiscussionHere, we show that a small EWAS on samples with high MeHg exposure variance can detect candidate differentially methylated CpGs and pathways of interest relevant to MeHg biology.

The interval, composition, and temporal distribution of calls were significantly different between isolated and paired marmosets.

Two-photon optogenetics has been shown to be a promising technology for mapping such monosynaptic connections via serial stimulation of neurons with single-cell resolution. However, this approach is limited in its ability to uncover connectivity at large scales because stimulating neurons one-by-one requires prohibitively long experiments. Here we developed novel computational tools that, when combined, enable learning of monosynaptic connectivity from high-speed holographic neural ensemble stimulation. First, we developed a model-based compressed sensing algorithm that identifies connections from postsynaptic responses evoked by stimulation of many neurons at once, considerably increasing the rate at which the existence and strength of synapses are screened. We show that this model-based approach, explicitly incorporating known biophysics of optogenetic mapping experiments, is critical for accurately determining synaptic connectivity using compressed sensing. Second, we developed a deep learning method that isolates the postsynaptic response evoked by each stimulus, allowing stimulation to rapidly switch between ensembles without waiting for the postsynaptic response to return to baseline. We then validated our approach by performing large-scale connectivity mapping experiments in slices from layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex. Together, our system increases the throughput of monosynaptic connectivity mapping by an order of magnitude over existing approaches, enabling the acquisition of connectivity maps at speeds needed to discover the synaptic circuitry implementing neural computations.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.26.509455", "title": "Aminoglycoside tolerance in Vibrio cholerae engages translational reprogramming associated with queuosine tRNA modification", "authors": "Fruchard, L.; Babosan, A.; Carvalho, A.; Lang, M.; Li, B.; Duchateau, M.; Giai Gianetto, Q.; Matondo, M.; Bonhomme, F.; Hatin, I.; Arbes, H.; Fabret, C.; Corler, E.; Sanchez, G.; MArchand, V.; Motorine, Y.; NAMY, O.; de Crecy-Lagard, V.; Mazel, D.; Baharoglu, Z.", "author_corresponding": "Zeynep Baharoglu", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institut Pasteur", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "4", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nd", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2022.09.26.509455.source.xml", "abstract": "Tgt is the enzyme modifying the guanine (G) in tRNAs with GUN anticodon to queuosine (Q). tgt is required for optimal growth of Vibrio cholerae in the presence of sub-lethal aminoglycoside concentrations.

However, it has remained unclear whether these characteristics are epiphenomena or are exploited for computation. Due to the challenge of specifically interfering with oscillatory network dynamics in neuronal systems, we simulated recurrent networks (RNNs) of damped harmonic oscillators in which oscillatory activity is enforced in each node, a choice well-supported by experimental findings. When trained on standard pattern recognition tasks, these harmonic oscillator networks (HORNs) outperformed non-oscillatory architectures with respect to learning speed, noise tolerance, and parameter efficiency. HORNs also reproduced a substantial number of characteristic features of neuronal systems such as the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. In trained HORNs, stimulus-induced interference patterns holistically represent the result of comparing sensory evidence with priors stored in recurrent connection weights, and learning-induced weight changes are compatible with Hebbian principles. Implementing additional features characteristic of natural networks, such as heterogeneous oscillation frequencies, inhomogeneous conduction delays, and network modularity, further enhanced HORN performance without requiring additional parameters. Taken together, our model allows us to give plausible a posteriori explanations for features of natural networks whose computational role has remained elusive. We conclude that neuronal systems are likely to exploit the unique dynamics of recurrent oscillator networks whose computational superiority critically depends on the oscillatory patterning of their nodal dynamics.

Cell size and shape have been informative in defining macrophage subtypes. Studies show pro and anti-inflammatory macrophages exhibit distinct migratory behaviors, in vitro, in 3D and in vivo but this link has not been rigorously studied. We apply both morphology and motility-based image processing approaches to analyze live cell images consisting of macrophage phenotypes. Macrophage subtypes are differentiated from primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages using a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). We show that morphology is tightly linked to motility, which leads to our hypothesis that motility analysis could be used alone or in conjunction with morphological features for improved prediction of macrophage subtypes. We train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict macrophage subtypes based on morphology alone, motility alone, and both morphology and motility combined. We show that motility has comparable predictive capabilities as morphology. However, using both measures can enhance predictive capabilities. While motility and morphological features can be individually ambiguous identifiers, together they provide significantly improved prediction accuracies (75%) from a training dataset of 1000 cells tracked over time using only phase contrast time-lapse microscopy. Thus, the approach combining cell motility and cell morphology information can lead to methods that accurately assess functionally diverse macrophage phenotypes quickly and efficiently. This can support the development of cost efficient and high through-put methods for screening biochemicals targeting macrophage polarization.\n\nAuthor summaryPrevious work has shown that macrophage phenotypes can be distinguished by their morphological characteristics. We extend this work to show that distinct motility patterns are linked to macrophage morphology. Thus, motility patterns can be used to differentiate phenotypes.

Whereas spinal and brainstem circuits implement forelimb and orofacial actions, whether there is a specialized cortical circuit that flexibly assembles these to achieve cross-body and oromanual coordination for skilled manipulation remains unclear. Here we discover a cortical region and its cell-type-specific circuitry that orchestrates body postures and oromanual coordination for food manipulation in mice. An optogenetic screen of cortical areas and projection neuron types identified a rostral forelimb-orofacial area (RFO), wherein activation of pyramidal tract (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic (ITPlxnD1) neurons induced concurrent posture, forelimb and orofacial eating-like movements. In a pasta-eating behavior, RFO PTFezf2 and ITPlxnD1 activity were closely correlated with picking up the pasta, adopting a sitting posture, oromanual manipulation, and hand-assisted biting. RFO inactivation and inhibition of RFO PTsFezf2 and ITsPlxnD1 impaired posture and oromanual coordination, leading to deficient pasta manipulation and biting. RFO is reciprocally connected to forelimb and orofacial sensorimotor areas as well as insular and visceral areas. Within this network, ITsPlxnD1 project bilaterally to the entire network and the ventrolateral striatum and PTsFezf2 project to multiple subcortical areas associated with forelimb and orofacial control.

PRDM16 contributes to a repressive role of BMP signalling on neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation. We demonstrate that PRDM16 regulates the genomic distribution of BMP pathway transcription factors, the SMAD4/pSMAD complex, preventing the activation of cell proliferation genes. When Prdm16 is lost, the SMAD complex relocates to nearby genomic regions, leading to abnormal upregulation of BMP target genes. This function of PRDM16 is also required for the specification of choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells. Through a single-cell resolution fluorescent in situ approach, we have observed that genes co-repressed by SMAD and PRDM16, such as Wnt7b and several cell cycle regulators, become overexpressed in Prdm16 mutant ChP.

In human cells, it depends on the binding to chromatin of various proteins, including RNA polymerases and numerous transcription factors (TFs). Observations indicate that these proteins tend to form macromolecular clusters, known as transcription factories, whose morphology and composition is still debated. While some microscopy experiments have revealed the presence of specialised factories, composed of similar TFs transcribing families of related genes, sequencing experiments suggest instead that mixed clusters may be prevalent, as a panoply of different TFs binds promiscuously the same chromatin region. The mechanisms underlying the formation of specialised or mixed factories remain elusive. With the aim of finding such mechanisms, here we develop a chromatin polymer model mimicking the chromatin binding-unbinding dynamics of different types of complexes of TFs. Surprisingly, both specialised (i.e., demixed) and mixed clusters spontaneously emerge, and which of the two types forms depends mainly on cluster size. The mechanism promoting mixing is the presence of non-specific interactions between chromatin and proteins, which become increasingly important as clusters become larger. This result, that we observe both in simple polymer models and more realistic ones for human chromosomes, reconciles the apparently contrasting experimental results obtained.

Here, we present a design approach to predict stable chimeras between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, creating synthetic spike proteins that display a desired conserved region and vary other regions.

We show that mycolactone-induced changes in endothelial morphology, adhesion, migration, and permeability are dependent on its action at the Sec61 translocon. Unbiased quantitative proteomics identified a profound effect on proteoglycans, driven by rapid loss of type II transmembrane proteins of the Golgi, including enzymes required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis, combined with a reduction in the core proteins themselves. Loss of the glycocalyx is likely to be of particular mechanistic importance, since knockdown of galactosyltransferase II (beta-1,3-galactotransferase 6; B3GALT6), the GAG linker-building enzyme, phenocopied the permeability and phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone. Additionally, mycolactone depleted many secreted basement membrane components and microvascular basement membranes were disrupted in vivo.

Nevertheless, previous research on sgACC functional connectivity (FC) in MDD has yielded inconsistent results, partly due to small sample sizes and limited statistical power. Furthermore, calculating sgACC-FC to target TMS individually is challenging. Methods: Leveraging a large multi-site cross-sectional sample (1660 MDD patients vs. 1341 healthy controls) from Phase II of the Depression Imaging REsearch ConsorTium (DIRECT), we systematically delineated case-control difference maps of sgACC-FC. Then, we explored the potential impact of such group-level abnormality profiles on the TMS target localization and clinical efficacy. Next, we developed an MDD big data-guided individualized TMS targeting algorithm to integrate group-level statistical maps with individual-level brain activity to localize TMS targets individually. Results: We found an enhanced sgACC-DLPFC FC in MDD patients compared to healthy controls (HC). Such group differences altered the position of the sgACC anti-correlation peak in the left DLPFC. In two independent clinical samples, we showed that the magnitude of TMS targets' case-control differences in sgACC FC was related to clinical improvement. The MDD big data-guided individualized TMS targeting algorithm may generate individualized TMS targets that are clinically superior to group-level targets. Interpretation: We reliably delineated MDD-related abnormalities of sgACC-FC profiles in a large, independently ascertained sample and demonstrated the potential impact of such case-control differences on FC-guided localization of TMS targets.

We develop a physiologically grounded model in which the extended duration of dendritic spikes equips each dendrite with a resettable memory of incoming signals.

There are now several open-source tools for tracking laboratory animals, but often these are only accurate under limited conditions (e.g. uniform lighting and background, uncluttered scenes, unobstructed focal animal). Tracking fish presents a particular challenge for these tools because movement at the waters surface introduces significant noise. Partial occlusion of the focal animal can also be troublesome, particularly when tracking the whole organism. But identifying the position of an animal is only part of the task - analysing the movement of the animal relative to their environment and experimental context is often what provides information about their behaviour. Therefore, the automated detection of physical objects and boundaries would also be beneficial, but this feature is not commonly incorporated into existing tracking software.

A major challenge to better understand metabolic regulation is to identify, from the hundreds or thousands of molecules, the key metabolites where the re-orientation of fluxes occurs. Here, a method called ISIS (for In Silico Identification of Switches) is proposed to locate these nodes in a metabolic network, based on the analysis of a set of flux vectors (obtained e.g. by parsimonious flux balance analysis with different inputs). A metabolite is considered as a switch if the fluxes at this point are redirected in a different way when conditions change. The soundness of ISIS is shown with four case studies, using both core and genome-scale metabolic networks of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Through these examples, we show that ISIS can identify hot-spots where fluxes are reoriented. Additionally, switch metabolites are deeply involved in post-translational modification of proteins, showing their importance in cellular regulation. In P. tricornutum, we show that Erythrose 4-phosphate is an important switch metabolite for mixotrophy suggesting the importance of this metabolite in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to orchestrate the flux variations between glycolysis, the Calvin cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway when the trophic mode changes. Finally, a comparison between ISIS and reporter metabolites identified with transcriptomic data confirms the key role of metabolites such as L-glutamate or L-aspartate in the yeast response to nitrogen input variation.

Using somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotency as a model system, we show that activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is tuned by cellular morphomechanic state to direct cell fate. Pluripotent cells and somatic cells reprogramming into pluripotency allocate large amounts of actin into their nucleus, which morphs cells to become taller than 10 m, a minimal height required for the pluripotent identity. Accumulated nuclear actin binds to TFII-I{Delta}, an atypical transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus upon signaling. TFII-I{Delta} also binds to and activates ERK. The binding of TFII-I{Delta} by nuclear actin reduces ERK activity, in coordination with changes in cell/colony height. The tight coupling between cell height and nuclear actin accumulation necessitates the degree of ERK tuning to be mild. Mild ERK inhibition by chemicals recapitulates the tuning by actin-TFII-I{Delta} and turns most cells in reprogramming cultures into pluripotency. Thus, we uncover a novel mechanism for how cell morphology couples to its identity via the actin-TFII-I{Delta}-ERK axis, identifying points of intervention in cell fate manipulation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.06.01.543135", "title": "Meaning-making behavior in a small-brained hominin, Homo naledi, from the late Pleistocene: contexts and evolutionary implications", "authors": "Fuentes, A.; Kissel, M.; Spikins, P.; Molopyane, K.; Hawks, J.; Berger, L.

How iron impacts Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) in vivo and development of immunity during infection is unclear.

Iron restriction lowered IL-12 and IFN-gamma in spleen and serum, but ratios of myeloid cells and the number and function of Natural Killer cells were unchanged. Iron restriction significantly impaired the development of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to T. gondii during replicating type II and attenuated vaccine strain cps1-1 infection.

Despite its importance, the rapid representation and estimation of numerosity is surprisingly imprecise and biased. However, a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory estimations, logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.\n\nAuthor summaryHumans have the ability to estimate the number of elements in a set without counting. We share this ability with other species, suggesting that it is evolutionarily relevant. However, despite its relevance, this sense is variable and biased. What is the origin of these imprecisions? We take the view that they are the result of an optimal use of limited neural resources. Because of these limitations, stimuli are encoded with noise. The observer then optimally decodes these noisy representations, taking into account its knowledge of the distribution of stimuli. We build on this view and incorporate stimulus presentation time (or contrast) directly into the encoding process using Brownian motion. This model can parsimoniously predict key characteristics of our perception and outperforms quantitatively and qualitatively a popular modeling approach that considers resource limitations at the stage of the response rather than the encoding.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.07.04.547323", "title": "Fractal cycles of sleep: a new aperiodic activity-based definition of sleep cycles", "authors": "Rosenblum, Y.; Jafarzadeh Esfahani, M.; Adelho\u0308fer, N.; Zerr, P.; Furrer, M.; Huber, R.; Roest, F.

While sleep cycles are considered fundamental components of sleep, their functional significance largely remains unclear. One of the reasons for a lack of research progress in this field is the absence of a data-driven definition of sleep cycles. Here, we proposed to base such a definition on fractal (aperiodic) neural activity, a well-established marker of arousal and sleep stages. We explored temporal dynamics of fractal activity during nocturnal sleep using electroencephalography in 205 healthy adults aged 18 - 75 years. Based on the observed pattern of fractal fluctuations, we introduced a new concept of fractal activity-based cycles of sleep or \"fractal cycles\" for short, defined as a time interval during which fractal activity descends from its local maximum to its local minimum and then leads back to the next local maximum. Then, we assessed correlations between fractal and classical (i.e., non-REM - REM) sleep cycle durations. We also studied cycles with skipped REM sleep, i.e., the cycles where the REM phase is replaced by lightening of sleep. Finally, we validated the fractal cycle concept in children and adolescents (range: 8 - 17 years, n = 21), the group characterized by deeper sleep and a higher frequency of cycles with skipped REM sleep, as well as in major depressive disorder (n = 111), the condition characterized by altered sleep structure (in addition to its clinical symptoms). We found that fractal and classical cycle durations (89 {+/-} 34 min vs 90 {+/-} 25 min) correlated positively (r = 0.5, p < 0.001). Cycle-to-cycle overnight dynamics showed an inverted U-shape of both fractal and classical cycle durations and a gradual decrease in absolute amplitudes of the fractal descents and ascents from early to late cycles. In adults, the fractal cycle duration and participant's age correlated negatively (r = -0.2, p = 0.006). Children and adolescents had shorter fractal cycles compared to young adults (76 {+/-} 34 vs 94 {+/-} 32 min, p < 0.001). The fractal cycle algorithm detected cycles with skipped REM sleep in 91 - 98% of cases. Medicated patients with depression showed longer fractal cycles compared to their own unmedicated state (107 {+/-} 51 min vs 92 {+/-} 38 min, p < 0.001) and age-matched controls (104 {+/-} 49 vs 88 {+/-} 31 min, p < 0.001).

High-resolution, accurate data on invertebrate populations and communities across scales are critical for informing conservation efforts. However, conventional data collection methodologies for invertebrates are expensive, labor intensive, and require substantial taxonomic expertise, limiting researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Novel optical techniques show promise for automating such data collection across scales as they operate unsupervised in remote areas. In this work, optical insect sensors were deployed in 20 agricultural fields in Kansas, USA. Measurements were compared to conventional assessments of insect diversity from sweep nets and Malaise traps. Species richness was estimated on optical insect data by applying a clustering algorithm to the optical insect sensors signal features of wing-beat frequency and body-to-wing ratio. Species richness correlated more strongly between the optical richness estimate and each of the conventional methods than between the two conventional methods, suggesting sensors can be a reliable indicator of invertebrate richness. Shannon- and Simpson indices were calculated for all three methods but were largely uncorrelated including between conventional methods. Although the technology is relatively new, optical sensors may provide next-generation insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of invertebrate biodiversity and their conservation.\n\nSignificance StatementThe implications of this research extend from the field level to the regional level. Much of what scientists understand about the decline of invertebrates comes from a small number of long-term studies that can be coarse and correlational in nature.

Identifying the specific residues where proteins bind to DNA is of paramount importance, as it enables the modeling of their interactions and facilitates downstream studies. Nevertheless, the development of accurate and efficient computational methods for this task remains a persistent challenge. Accurate prediction of protein-DNA binding sites has far-reaching implications for understanding molecular mechanisms, disease processes, drug discovery, and synthetic biology applications. It helps bridge the gap between genomics and functional biology, enabling researchers to uncover the intricacies of cellular processes and advance our knowledge of the biological world. The method used to predict DNA binding residues in this study is a potent combination of conventional bioinformatics tools, protein language models, and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning classifiers. On a dataset of protein-DNA binding sites, our model is meticulously trained, and it is then rigorously examined using several experiments. As indicated by higher predictive behavior with AUC values on two benchmark datasets, the results show superior performance when compared to existing models. The suggested model has a strong capacity for generalization and shows specificity for DNA-binding sites. We further demonstrated the adaptability of our model as a universal framework for binding site prediction by training it on a variety of protein-ligand binding site datasets. In conclusion, our innovative approach for predicting protein-DNA binding residues holds great promise in advancing our understanding of molecular interactions, thus paving the way for several groundbreaking applications in the field of molecular biology and genetics.

By analogy to pacemakers in the GI and lower urinary tracts, proposed cLV pacemaker cells include interstitial cells of Cajal like cells (ICLC) or the lymphatic muscle (LMCs) cells themselves. Here we combined immunofluorescence and scRNAseq analyses with electrophysiological methods to examine the cellular constituents of the mouse cLV wall and assess whether any cell type exhibited morphological and functional processes characteristic of pacemaker cells: a continuous if not contiguous network integrated into the electrical syncytium; spontaneous Ca2+ transients; and depolarization-induced propagated contractions. We employed inducible Cre (iCre) mouse models routinely used to target these specific cell populations including: c-kitCreERT2 to target ICLC; Pdgfr{beta}CreERT2 to target pericyte-like cells; PdgfrCreERTM to target CD34+ adventitial cells and ICLC; and Myh11CreERT2 to target LMCs directly. These specific inducible Cre lines were crossed to the fluorescent reporter ROSA26mT/mG, the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f, and the light-activated cation channel rhodopsin2 (ChR2). c-KitCreERT2 labeled both a sparse population of LECs and round adventitial cells that responded to the mast cell activator compound 48-80. Pdgfr{beta}CreERT2 drove recombination in both adventitial cells and LMCs, limiting its power to discriminate a pericyte-specific population. PdgfrCreERTM labeled a large population of interconnected, oak leaf-shaped cells primarily along the adventitial surface of the vessel. Of these cells, only LMCs consistently, but heterogeneously, displayed spontaneous Ca2+ events during the diastolic period of the contraction cycle, and whose frequency was modulated in a pressure-dependent manner. Optogenetic depolarization through the expression of ChR2 under control of Myh11CreERT2, but not PdgfrCreERTM or c-KitCreERT2, resulted in propagated contractions upon photo-stimulation. Membrane potential recordings in LMCs demonstrated that the rate of diastolic depolarization significantly correlated with contraction frequency.

We use a collection of 34 E. coli C LPS strains, each of which is resistant to {Phi}X174, and has either a \"rough\" or \"deep rough\" LPS phenotype. Growth of the bacterial strains with the deep rough phenotype is inhibited at low concentrations of chloramphenicol (and, to a much lesser degree, gentamicin). Treating E. coli C wildtype with {Phi}X174 and chloramphenicol eliminates the emergence of mutants with the deep rough phenotype, and thereby slows the evolution of resistance to phage infection. At slightly lower chloramphenicol concentrations, phage resistance rates are similar to those observed at high concentrations; yet, we show that the diversity of possible mutants is much larger than at higher chloramphenicol concentrations. These data suggest that specific antibiotic concentrations can lead to synergistic phage-antibiotic interactions that disappear at higher antibiotic concentrations.

We identified several shifts towards smaller relative testes mass, presumably reflecting reduced sperm competition. Several sperm traits were associated with relative testes mass, suggesting that mating system evolution selects for convergent suites of traits related to sperm competitive ability. We predicted that sperm competition would also drive more rapid molecular divergence in species with large testes. Contrary to this, we found that many spermatogenesis genes evolved more rapidly in species with smaller relative testes mass due to relaxed purifying selection. While some reproductive genes evolved rapidly under recurrent positive selection, relaxed selection played a greater role in underlying rapid evolution in small testes species.

To address this, we developed an optogenetic approach to delineate the visual center and surround zones of individual neurons in the superficial layer of the superior colliculus (SCs) using only retinal ganglion cell input. Using whole-cell recordings, we demonstrate that surround network activation suppresses center excitability, indicating that SCs circuitry is self-sufficient in driving center-surround dynamics. Through cell-type-specific trans-synaptic tracing and large-scale modeling, we identified an SCs-based circuit with two key motifs driving surround modulation: recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition.

We demonstrate that the SC can independently generate center-surround interactions that could contribute to visual saliency through local circuits without top-down input. This ability represents a computation that has been conserved since the dawn of vertebrate evolution. By mapping these interactions, we reveal that the mouse SC actively induces visual surround suppression.

Classical P4 signaling operates through nuclear receptors that regulate transcription. In addition, P4 signals through membrane P4 receptors (mPRs) in a rapid nongenomic modality. Despite the established physiological importance of P4 nongenomic signaling, the details of its signal transduction cascade remain elusive. Here, using Xenopus oocyte maturation as a well- established physiological readout of nongenomic P4 signaling, we identify the lipid hydrolase ABHD2 (/{beta} hydrolase domain-containing protein 2) as an essential mPR{beta} co-receptor to trigger meiosis. We show using functional assays coupled to unbiased and targeted cell-based lipidomics that ABHD2 possesses a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity that requires mPR{beta}. This PLA2 activity bifurcates P4 signaling by inducing clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPR{beta}, resulting in the production of lipid messengers that are G-protein coupled receptors agonists. Therefore, P4 drives meiosis by inducing an ABHD2 PLA2 activity that requires both mPR{beta} and ABHD2 as obligate co-receptors.\n\nSignificance StatementNongenomic progesterone signaling is important for many physiological functions yet the details of its signaling remain elusive. Here we define the early signaling steps downstream of membrane progesterone receptor {beta} (mPR{beta}) during Xenopus oocyte meiosis. We show that progesterone requires two cell membrane receptors to work in unison to signal. The co-receptor complex possesses lipase activity that produces lipid messenger and induces receptor endocytosis to trigger meiosis progression.

To overcome this deficit, we developed KaryoTap, a method combining custom targeted DNA sequencing panels for the Tapestri platform with a computational framework to enable detection of chromosome- and chromosome arm-scale aneuploidy (gains or losses) and copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity in all human chromosomes across thousands of single cells simultaneously.

However, heterogeneity between and within traditional fiber types remains underexplored. Indeed, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the only principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, metabolic, ribosomal, and cell junction proteins are a source of multi-dimensional variation between skeletal muscle fibers. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data suggests that type 2X fibers are not phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. We also characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA.

We illustrate its capabilities by first constructing biologically inspired locomotor controllers that use ascending motor feedback to perform path integration and head stabilization.

Finally, we illustrate more biorealistic modeling in two ways: our model navigates a complex odor plume using a Drosophila odor taxis strategy, and it uses a connectome-constrained visual system network to follow another simulated fly.

Mechanistically we show this shift to be a function of two distinct ACE2 pools based on TMPRS22 association with the ACE2 Collectrin-Like Domain (CLD). In engineered cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, ACE2/TMPRSS2 complexes led to either augmentation or attenuation of viral infectivity of pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages, respectively. Mutagenesis of the ACE2-CLD TMPRSS2 cleavage site in ACE2 restored infectivity across all Omicron lineages through enabling ACE2 binding that facilitated TMPRSS2 activation of viral fusion.

ACE2-TMPRSS2 pool model to reconcile the evolving entry requirements of SARS-CoV-2 and changes in viral tropism in vivo. A. Both SARS-CoV-1 and early SARS-CoV-2 (pre-Omicron) lineages have molecular dual tropism, with efficient entry when ACE2 (blue protein) can form complexes with TMPRSS2 (green protein) and in settings where TMPRSS2 is excluded from ACE2 (C4-ACE2 CLD). In both settings ACE2 initially engages SARS-CoV-2 spike and fusion is then triggered through TMPRSS2 cleavage of the Spike S2 domain B. Over time, the dual tropism for two distinct pools of ACE2 (with and without TMPRSS2) has been lost, with consolidation towards ACE2 where TMPRSS2 is no longer in a complex. With the arrival of Omicron lineages, ACE2-TMPRSS2 complexes could no longer enable efficient Spike S2 cleavage and fusogenic activation (TMPRSS2 \"off\" confirmation\"). Rather, only TMPRSS2 uncoupled from ACE2 could facilitate the latter cleavage of S2. C. Over time this has further consolidated over generations of omicron lineages from 2022 lineages (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5) through to 2023 lineages (XBB.1.5) and now in 2024 JN.1 lineages such as KP.3. Overall, this supports the initial molecular tropism of early SARS-CoV-2 clades to be similar to that observed for SARS-CoV-1, with dual tropism across both ACE2 pools and replication proceeding in tissues where ACE2-TMPRSS2 complexes would be prevalent (e.g. Lung). The evolution away from ACE2-TMPRSS2 complexes towards ACE2 where TMPRSS2 is structurally uncoupled (e.g. ACE2 as a chaperone for solute carriers SLCA619 or SLCA620) is consistent selection of this ACE2 pool in a manner that has sustained transmission fitness within the human population.\n\nC_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.09.22.558524", "title": "TIM-4 Identifies Effector B cells Expressing a ROR\u03b3T-driven Proinflammatory Cytokine Module That Promotes Immune responsiveness", "authors": "Ding, Q.; Wu, Y.; Triglia, E.

In the case of hover-feeding hawkmoths of the species Manduca sexta, proboscis mechanosensation and vision are known to combine linearly in tracking of moving flowers. This tracking behavior is affected by light-levels, and visual compensation is necessary for robust flower-tracking. Whether the mechanosensory response also adjusts to light-level, in order to produce linear combination across luminance contexts, is not known. We applied control theoretic analyses to study integration of mechanosensory and visual information in flower tracking hawkmoths in the context of high luminance.

Under the conditions of high luminance, we verified the linear combination of mechanosensory and visual systems, and the complementary modulation of these systems. We show that both systems tune their frequency response with changing environmental light level,while keeping their combined error low at relevant frequencies.

This resulted from TL-dependent binding of TRF2 between telomeres and the hTERT promoter. hTERT promoter-bound TRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the hTERT promoter. Cell lines from different tissue types (fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere elongation/shortening gave increase/decrease in hTERT, respectively. Mechanistically, we show hTERT promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the canonical PRC2-complex inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a TL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter activity from an exogenously inserted hTERT reporter. Increase in TL over days followed by gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of hTERT in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for hTERT regulation. Notably on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the hTERT promoter was evident along with telomere elongation and hTERT upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in iPSCs, hTERT promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with marked reduction in hTERT further supporting the causal role of TL in hTERT transcription. Mechanisms of tight control of hTERT by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in telomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing and pluripotency.\n\nTeaserTelomere length controls hTERT expression by modulating TRF2 distribution and PRC2-mediated repression, highlighting a self-regulatory mechanism in cancer.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.10.14.562349", "title": "STING induces HOIP-mediated synthesis of M1 ubiquitin chains to stimulate NFkB signaling", "authors": "Fischer, T.

This family includes the genus Ludwigia L., which is comprised of 82 species. In this study, we focused on the two aquatic invasive species Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala (Lgh) and Ludwigia peploides subsp montevidensis (Lpm) largely distributed in aquatic environments in North America and in Europe. Both species have been found to degrade major watersheds leading ecological and economical damages. Genomic resources for Onagraceae are limited, with only Ludwigia octovalvis (Lo) plastid genome available for the genus Ludwigia L. at the time of our study. This scarcity constrains phylogenetic, population genetics, and genomic studies. To brush up genomic ressources, new complete plastid genomes of Ludwigia grandiflora subps. hexapetala (Lgh) and Ludwigia peploides subsp. montevidensis (Lpm) were generated using a combination of MiSeq (Illumina) and GridION (Oxford Nanopore) sequencing technologies. These plastomes were then compared to the published Ludwigia octovalvis (Lo) plastid genome, which was re-annotated by the authors. We initially sequenced and assembled the chloroplast (cp) genomes of Lpm and Lgh using a hybrid strategy combining short and long reads sequences. We observed the existence of two Lgh haplotypes and two potential Lpm haplotypes. Lgh, Lpm, and Lo plastomes were similar in terms of genome size (around 159 Kb), gene number, structure, and inverted repeat (IR) boundaries, comparable to other species in the Myrtales order. A total of 45 to 65 SSRs (simple sequence repeats), were detected, depending on the species, with the majority consisting solely of A and T, which is common among angiosperms. Four chloroplast genes (matK, accD, ycf2 and ccsA) were found under positive selection pressure, which is commonly associated with plant development, and especially in aquatic plants such as Lgh, and Lpm. Our hybrid sequencing approach revealed the presence of two Lgh plastome haplotypes which will help to advance phylogenetic and evolutionary studies, not only specifically for Ludwigia, but also the Onagraceae family and Myrtales order.

Foraging theory has produced very general formalizations of the optimal patch-leaving decisions rational individuals should make. One is Charnovs Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), which models the sequential visit of habitat patches and their spatial distribution. The MVT has a simple intuitive graphical interpretation in terms of gain functions and travel times. However, it considers only energy gains, and the effect of predation risk on the time allocation strategy is notoriously lacking. An important development that includes predation risk was Browns economic treatment of optimal patch leaving decisions, the basis of giving-up density (GUD) theory, often cited as an extension of the MVT. However, it is a more abstract result that does not have the specificities or graphical appeal of the MVT. Although both successful, the two theories are cited by distinct communities and are seldom connected in texbooks. Here we formally introduce the risk-MVT (rMVT), a generalization of the MVT that can incorporate most types of predation risks. We show that Browns GUD-theory is equivalent to a rMVT, but applies for one type of predation risk only. The rMVT retains the structure and graphical simplicity of the MVT, but implies a shift from residence time to expected dose of risk (micromort units, as used in decision analysis) as the domain over which rates of gain are computed and maximized. Applications of the rMVT show that different types of risk can yield opposite responses of optimal strategies to an increase in the risk level, and predict differential responses of behaviours observed in experimental versus natural conditions. The risk-MVT can also be used to predict the optimal level of risk taking, or \"optimal boldness\", and suggests that individuals should generally be bolder in riskier habitats.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.11.04.565620", "title": "MiRGraph: A hybrid deep learning approach toidentify microRNA-target interactions by integrating heterogeneous regulatory network and genomic sequences", "authors": "Liu, P.; Liu, Y.; Luo, J.; Li, Y.", "author_corresponding": "Yue Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "McGill University", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "3", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "bioinformatics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2023.11.04.565620.source.xml", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediates gene expression regulation by targeting specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the cytoplasm.

There is currently a lack of MTIs prediction methods that simultaneously perform feature learning from heterogeneous gene regulatory network (GRN) and genomic sequences. To improve the prediction performance of MTIs, we present a novel transformer-based multiview feature learning method - MiRGraph, which consists of two main modules for learning the sequence-based and GRN-based feature embedding. For the former, we utilize the mature miRNA sequences and the complete 3UTR sequence of the target mRNAs to encode sequence features using a hybrid transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) (TransCNN) architecture. For the latter, we utilize a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) module to extract the relational and structural information from the GRN consisting of miRNA-miRNA, gene-gene and miRNA-target interactions. The TransCNN and HGT modules can be learned end-to-end to predict experimentally validated MTIs from MiRTarBase.

Traditionally they are identified from large DNA/RNA libraries using in vitro methods, like Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX).

Addressing this, we proposed AptaDiff, the first in silico aptamer design and optimization method based on the diffusion model. Our Aptadiff can generate aptamers beyond the constraints of high-throughput sequencing data, leveraging motif-dependent latent embeddings from variational autoencoder, and can optimize aptamers by affinity-guided aptamer generation according to Bayesian optimization. Comparative evaluations revealed AptaDiffs superiority over existing aptamer generation methods in terms of quality and fidelity across four high-throughput screening data targeting distinct proteins. Moreover, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments were conducted to validate the binding affinity of aptamers generated through Bayesian optimization for two target proteins. The results unveiled a significant boost of 87.9% and 60.2% in RU values, along with a 3.6-fold and 2.4-fold decrease in KD values for the respective target proteins.

Complex neural control mechanisms underly these behaviours, which are controlled by specialized neural circuits. Locusta migratoria is a tractable organism for examining flight muscle coordination of collision avoidance behaviour. Loose tether experiments have shown that locusts free to manoeuvre in 3-dimensional space will adjust wing beat frequency, coordinate timing of a single bilateral pair of flight muscles, and coordinate forewing asymmetry during the downstroke. Current experiments were designed to test two hypotheses: 1) Synchrony between flight steering muscles increases prior to initiation of intentional flight steering behaviour. We analyzed EMG recordings from bilaterally paired forewing m97 (1st basalar), m99 (subalar), and hindwing m127 (1st basalar) steering muscles. 2) Timing and synchrony of flight muscle activity correlate with body orientation changes during intentional flight steering. Concurrent electromyographic (EMG) and high-speed video allowed for simultaneous measurements of muscle activity and body orientation changes. We found that during turns, ipsilateral synchronization between fore (Lm97) and hind (Lm127) occurred, followed by bilateral synchrony between left and right forewing flight muscles Lm97 and Rm97. These synchrony events correlate strongly with onset of turns and body orientation changes within the pitch and roll rotational planes. These findings demonstrate the earliest detectable muscle activity event that predicts the initialisation of turning during collision avoidance behaviour.\n\nSummary statementSynchronization of locust forewing flight muscles strongly correlates with body rotation during flight steering evoked by objects approaching on a collision course.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.11.30.569159", "title": "Quantifying the diverse contributions of hierarchical muscle interactions to motor function", "authors": "O'Reilly, D.; Hilt, P.; de Castro Aguiar, R.; Shaw, W.; Astill, S.; Delis, I.", "author_corresponding": "Ioannis Delis", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Leeds", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "6", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2023.11.30.569159.source.xml", "abstract": "The muscle synergy concept suggests that the human motor system is organised into functional modules comprised of muscles  working together towards common task-goals.

Here, we produced microfluidic channels that contained sediment-mimicking obstacles to study swimming of magnetotactic bacteria in a near-realistic environment. Magnetotactic bacteria are microorganisms that form chains of nanomagnets and that orient in Earth's magnetic field. The obstacles were produced based on micro-computer tomography reconstructions of bacteria-rich sediment samples. We characterized the swimming of the cells through these channels and found that swimming throughput was highest for physiological magnetic fields. This observation was confirmed by extensive computer simulations using an active Brownian particle model, which were parameterized based on experimental trajectories, in particular with the trajectories near the sediment-mimicking obstacles, from which the interactions of the swimming bacteria with the obstacles were determined. The simulations were used to quantify the swimming throughput in detail. They showed the behavior seen in experiments, but also exhibited considerable variability between different channel geometries. The simulations indicate that swimming at strong field is impeded by the trapping of bacteria in 'corners' that require transient swimming against the magnetic field for escape. At weak fields, the direction of swimming is almost random, making the process inefficient as well. We confirmed the trapping effect in our experiments and showed that lowering the field strength allows the bacteria to escape. We hypothesize that over the course of evolution, magnetotactic bacteria have thus evolved to produce magnetic properties that are adapted to the geomagnetic field in order to balance movement and orientation in such crowded environments.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.12.08.570752", "title": "Cortical tracking of postural sways during standing balance.", "authors": "Legrand, T.; Mongold, S.

Center-of-pressure (CoP) fluctuations and electroencephalographic cortical activity were recorded as young healthy participants performed balance tasks during which sensory information was manipulated, by either removal or alteration. We found that postural sways are represented in ongoing cortical activity during challenging balance conditions, in the form of CKC at 1-6 Hz. Time delays between cortical activity and CoP features indicated that both afferent and efferent pathways contribute to CKC, wherein the brain would monitor the CoP velocity and control its position. Importantly, CKC was behaviorally relevant, as it predicted the increase in instability brought by alteration of sensory information.

We tested 73 (Mage = 65.51) neurologically healthy older adults and collected neuroimaging (functional, structural, and perfusion MRI), cardiorespiratory fitness, and behavioural performance data to investigate a well-documented, prominent cognitive challenge for older adults: word-finding failures. We aimed to uncover associations between predictors, which have previously been theoretically-implicated, in explaining age-related tip-of-the-tongue rates.

To resolve this question, we performed scATAC-seq in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 16 children with asthma with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and treated with dexamethasone (DEX), an antiinflammatory glucocorticoid. We analyzed changes in chromatin accessibility, measured transcription factor motif activity, and identified treatment and cell-type specific transcription factors that drive changes in both gene expression mean and variability. We observed strong positive linear dependence between motif response and their target gene expression changes, but negative in variability changes. This result suggests that an increase of transcription factor binding tightens the variability of gene expression around the mean. We then annotated genetic variants in chromatin accessibility peaks and response motifs followed by computational fine-mapping of eQTL signals from a pediatric asthma cohort.

The slower reaction times observed in conceptual tasks compared to perceptual tasks were primarily driven by the larger decision boundary and longer non-decision time associated with conceptual features, which could not be compensated by their faster evidence accumulation rates. Using single-trial multivariate decoding of MEG (magnetoencephalography) data to examine the timing of neural representations of different features, we found that selective attention reversed the onset times of perceptual and conceptual features in the occipital and parietal lobes during perception.

In Drosophila melanogaster, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) together with intestinal cell renewal play a key role in eliminating gut microbes. A complementary mechanism would be to isolate and treat pathogenic bacteria while allowing colonization by commensals. Using real-time imaging to follow the fate of ingested bacteria, we demonstrate that while commensal Lactiplantibacillus plantarum freely circulate within the intestinal lumen, pathogenic strains such as Erwinia carotovora or Bacillus thuringiensis, are blocked in the anterior midgut where they are rapidly eliminated by antimicrobial peptides. This sequestration of pathogenic bacteria in the anterior midgut requires the Duox enzyme in enterocytes, and both TrpA1 and Dh31 in enteroendocrine cells. Supplementing larval food with hCGRP, the human homolog of Dh31, is sufficient to block the bacteria, suggesting the existence of a conserved mechanism. While the IMD pathway is essential for eliminating the trapped bacteria, it is dispensable for the blockage. Genetic manipulations impairing bacterial compartmentalization result in abnormal colonization of posterior midgut regions by pathogenic bacteria. Despite a functional IMD pathway, this ectopic colonization leads to bacterial proliferation and larval death, demonstrating the critical role of bacteria anterior sequestration in larval defense. Our study reveals a temporal orchestration during which pathogenic bacteria, but not innocuous, are confined in the anterior part of the midgut in which they are eliminated in an IMD pathway dependent manner.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTypically, when considering the immune response of animals to infection, we focus on classical immunity, encompassing both innate and adaptive aspects such as antimicrobials and circulating immune cells. However, a broader perspective on immunity includes additional strategies that enhance host protection, such as behavioral avoidance and internal mechanisms that restrict pathogen propagation. In our study using Drosophila larvae as a model, we uncovered spatially and temporally interconnected events that are crucial for effectively combating intestinal infections. Our findings reveal a two-step defense mechanism: first, the larvae rapidly discriminate between bacterial strains, effectively confining hazardous ones in the anterior section of the intestine. These blocked bacteria trigger the synthesis and release of antimicrobial peptides by the host, which ultimately eradicate the entrapped pathogens. Our experiments show that larvae capable of both limiting bacteria spreading and producing antimicrobial peptides withstand infections. In contrast, the absence of either one of these sequential defenses results in high mortality among the larvae, emphasizing the importance of each step and the necessity of their precise coordination in the immune response.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.01.28.577631", "title": "Organic macromolecules transport a significant proportion of the calcium precursor for nacre formation.", "authors": "Macias-Sanchez, E.; Huang, X.; Willinger, M.

These loci are scattered throughout the genome and are individually responsible only for small fractions of the total heritable trait variance. The recently proposed omnigenic model provides a conceptual framework to explain these observations by postulating that numerous distant loci contribute to each complex trait via effect propagation through intracellular regulatory networks. We formalize this conceptual framework by proposing the \"quantitative omnigenic model\" (QOM), a statistical model that combines prior knowledge of the regulatory network topology with genomic data. By applying our model to gene expression traits in yeast, we demonstrate that QOM achieves similar gene expression prediction performance to traditional GWAS with hundreds of times less parameters, while simultaneously extracting candidate causal and quantitative chains of effect propagation through the regulatory network for every individual gene. We estimate the fraction of heritable trait variance in cis- and in trans-, break the latter down by effect propagation order, assess the trans- variance not attributable to transcriptional regulation, and show that QOM correctly accounts for the low-dimensional structure of gene expression covariance. We furthermore demonstrate the relevance of QOM for systems biology, by employing it as a statistical test for the quality of regulatory network reconstructions, and linking it to the propagation of non-transcriptional (including environmental) effects.\n\nSignificance statementGenetic variation leads to differences in traits implicated in health and disease. Identifying genetic variants associated with these traits is spearheaded by \"genome-wide association studies\" (GWAS) - statistically rigorous procedures whose power has grown with the number of genotyped samples. Nevertheless, GWAS have a substantial shortcoming: they are ill-equipped to detect the causal basis and reveal the complex systemic mechanisms of polygenic traits. Even a single genetic change can propagate throughout the entire genetic regulatory network causing a myriad of spurious detections, thereby significantly limiting GWAS usefulness. To this end, we propose a novel statistical approach that incorporates known regulatory network information with the potential to boost interpretability of state-of-the-art genomic analyses while simultaneously extracting systems biology insights.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.02.06.579077", "title": "Unveiling Multi-level and Multi-modal Semantic Representations in the Human Brain using Large Language Models", "authors": "Nakagi, Y.; Matsuyama, T.; Koide-Majima, N.; Yamaguchi, H.

Strikingly, this principle even held during search in natural scenes in two additional experiments. When increasing cognitive demand experimentally through an auditory counting task, participants made fewer saccades and especially cut costly directions.

When objects are lifted, visual information about size can be combined with haptic feedback about weight, and a naive application of Bayes rule predicts that the perceived weight of larger objects should be exaggerated and smaller objects underestimated. Instead it is the smaller of two objects of equal weight that is perceived as heavier, a phenomenon termed the Size-Weight Illusion (SWI). Here we provide a normative explanation of the SWI based on principles of efficient coding, which dictate that stimulus properties should be encoded with a fidelity that depends on how frequently those properties are encountered in the environment. We show that the precision with which human observers estimate object weight varies as a function of both mass and volume in a manner consistent with the estimated joint distribution of those properties among everyday objects. We further show that participants seemingly \"anti-Bayesian\" biases (the SWI) are quantitatively predicted by Bayesian estimation when taking into account the gradient of discriminability induced by efficient encoding. The related Material-Weight Illusion (MWI) can also be accounted for on these principles, with surface material providing a visual cue that changes expectations about object density. The efficient coding model is further compatible with a wide range of previous observations, including the adaptability of weight illusions and properties of \"non-illusory\" objects.

For several decades, Forest Europe indicators assessed the state of European forests, in particular their biodiversity. However, no extensive study has been conducted to date to assess their performance - i.e. the capacity of the indicators to reflect variations in biodiversity - against multitaxonomic data. We hypothesized that no single biodiversity indicator from Forest Europe can represent overall forest biodiversity, but that several indicators would reflect habitat quality for at least some taxa in a comprehensive way.

Although there is growing evidence that the auditory system relies on statistical representations for perceiving and coding natural sounds, it is less clear how statistical cues and neural representations contribute to segregating speech in natural auditory scenes. We demonstrate that human listeners rely on mid-level statistics to segregate and recognize speech in environmental noise. Using natural backgrounds and variants with perturbed spectro-temporal statistics, we show that speech recognition accuracy at a fixed noise level varies extensively across natural backgrounds (0% to 100%). Furthermore, for each background the unique interference created by summary statistics can mask or unmask speech, thus hindering or improving speech recognition. To identify the neural coding strategy and statistical cues that influence accuracy, we developed generalized perceptual regression, a framework that links summary statistics from a neural model to word recognition accuracy. Whereas a peripheral cochlear model accounts for only 60% of perceptual variance, summary statistics from a mid-level auditory midbrain model accurately predicts single trial sensory judgments, accounting for more than 90% of the perceptual variance. Furthermore, perceptual weights from the regression framework identify which statistics and tuned neural filters are influential and how they impact recognition.

The high-dimensionality, low sample size nature of transcriptomic sequence data is a double-edged sword, however, as it provides abundant information but makes traditional statistics difficult. Machine learning has many features which handle high-dimensional data well and is thus useful in genetic sequence applications.

This challenge is compounded when prevalence reaches detectable levels only at specific times of year. In these cases, statistical models designed to predict the timing of peak prevalence could guide field sampling for active infections. Thus, we develop a general model that leverages routinely collected serosurveillance data to optimize sampling for elusive pathogens by predicting time windows of peak prevalence.

Despite its proposal as a general cortical mechanism, including for speech processing, whether or how predictive coding functions in single-neuron responses to vocal communication signals is unknown. As a proxy internal model, we developed a neural network that uses current sensory context to predict future spectrotemporal features of a vocal communication signal, birdsong. We then represent birdsong as either weighted sets of latent predictive features evolving in time, or as time-varying prediction-errors that reflect the difference between ongoing network-predicted and actual song. Using these spectrotemporal, predictive, and prediction-error song representations, we fit linear/non-linear receptive fields to single neuron responses recorded from caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), caudal mesopallium (CMM) and Field L, analogs of mammalian auditory cortices, in anesthetized European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, listening to conspecific songs. In all three regions, the predictive features of song yield the single best model of song-evoked spiking responses, but unique information about all three representations (signal, prediction, and error) is carried in the spiking responses to song. The relative weighting of this information varies across regions, but in contrast to many computational predictive coding models neither predictive nor error responses are segregated in separate neurons.

Mutations can modify the activity of regulatory DNA, and also create new regulatory DNA, a process called regulatory emergence. Non-regulatory and regulatory DNA contain motifs to which transcription factors may bind. In prokaryotes, gene expression requires a stretch of DNA called a promoter, which contains two motifs called -10 and -35 boxes. However, these motifs may occur in both promoters and non-promoter DNA in multiple copies. They have been implicated in some studies to improve promoter activity, and in others to repress it. Here, we ask whether the presence of such motifs in different genetic sequences influences promoter evolution and emergence. To understand whether and how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution, we start from 50 \"promoter islands\", DNA sequences enriched with -10 and -35 boxes. We mutagenize these starting \"parent\" sequences, and measure gene expression driven by 240000 of the resulting mutants. We find that the probability that mutations create an active promoter varies more than 200-fold, and is not correlated with the number of promoter motifs. For parent sequences without promoter activity, mutations created over 1500 new -10 and -35 boxes at unique positions in the library, but only [~]0.3% of these resulted in de-novo promoter activity. Only [~]13% of all -10 and -35 boxes contribute to de-novo promoter activity. For parent sequences with promoter activity, mutations create new -10 and -35 boxes in 11 specific positions that partially overlap with preexisting ones to modulate expression. We also find that -10 and -35 boxes do not repress promoter activity. Overall, our work demonstrates how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution.

However, the cell-specific mechanisms governing ADAMTS7 proatherogenicity remain unclear. To determine which vascular cell types express ADAMTS7, we interrogated single-cell RNA sequencing of human carotid atherosclerosis and found ADAMTS7 expression in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and fibroblasts. We subsequently created SMC- and EC-specific Adamts7 conditional knockout and transgenic mice. Conditional knockout of Adamts7 in either cell type is insufficient to reduce atherosclerosis, whereas transgenic induction in either cell type increases atherosclerosis. In SMC transgenic mice, this increase coincides with an expansion of lipid-laden SMC foam cells and decreased fibrous cap formation. RNA-sequencing in SMCs revealed an upregulation of lipid uptake genes typically assigned to macrophages. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that ADAMTS7 increases SMC oxLDL uptake through increased CD36 levels. Furthermore, Cd36 expression is increased due to increased levels of PU.1, a transcription factor typically associated with myeloid fate determination. In summary, Adamts7 expression in either SMCs or ECs promotes SMC foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.

Analyses of gene networks and upstream regulators implicated processes involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination in WIA, neuroinflammation in Demand, and metabolism in Reinstatement. Motif analysis of ATAC-seq showed changes in chromatin accessibility to a small set of transcription factor (TF) binding sites as a function either of opioid exposure (i.e., morphine versus saline) generally or of individual vulnerability specifically. Some of these were shared across the 3 paradigms and others were unique to each.

However, recent studies revealed significant individual differences in the spontaneous tendency to synchronize to the beat. Some individuals tend to adapt their walking pace to the beat while others show little or no adjustment. However, to date, there is no protocol sensitive to individual differences in adapting to rhythmic stimuli while walking that can experimentally validate this phenomenon. To fill this gap, we introduce the Ramp protocol assessing spontaneous adaptation to a change in an auditory rhythmic stimulus in a gait task. First, participants start to walk at their preferred cadence without stimulation. After several steps, a metronome is presented, timed to match the rhythm of the participant's heel strike. Then, the metronome tempo progressively departs from the participant's cadence by either accelerating or decelerating. The implementation of the Ramp protocol required real-time detection of heel strike and auditory stimuli aligned with participants' preferred cadence. To achieve this, we developed the TeensyStep device, which we validated compared to a gold standard for step detection. We also demonstrated the sensitivity of the Ramp protocol to individual differences in the spontaneous response to a tempo changing rhythmic stimulus by introducing a new measure: the Response Score.

Hence, both factors lead to an overall reduction in genome size, but the coding density of the genome appears to be determined by N x mu.

This metric is broadly applicable to biochemical entities, including proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids, or cells; as long as a relevant similarity function is defined for them. Recognizing the wide range of similarity functions used in biochemistry, we propose criteria to guide the selection of the most appropriate metric for partitioning. We also introduce a new partitioning algorithm that generates more challenging test sets, and we propose statistical methods for comparing models based on AU-GOOD.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate the insights that can be gained from this framework by applying it to two different use cases: developing predictors for pharmaceutical properties of small molecules, and using protein language models as embeddings to build biophysical property predictors.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.03.15.585236", "title": "Curating models from BioModels: Developing a workflow for creating OMEX files", "authors": "Xu, J.; Smith, L.", "author_corresponding": "Jin Xu", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Washington", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "3", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "systems biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.03.15.585236.source.xml", "abstract": "The reproducibility of computational biology models can be greatly facilitated by widely adopted standards and public repositories.

Considerable recent efforts are therefore being channeled towards understanding the nature of pathogen emergence, their spread and evolution. Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. perforans (Xep), one of the causal agents of bacterial spot of tomato, rapidly emerged and displaced other bacterial spot xanthomonads in tomato production regions around the world. In less than three decades, it has become a dominant xanthomonad pathogen in tomato production systems across the world and presents a model for understanding diversification of recently emerged bacterial plant pathogens. Although Xep has been continuously monitored in Florida since its discovery, the global population structure and evolution at the genome-scale is yet to be fully explored. The objectives of this work were to determine genetic diversity globally to ascertain if different tomato production regions contain genetically distinct Xep populations, to examine genetic relatedness of strains collected in tomato seed production areas in East Asia and other production regions, and to evaluate variation in type III effectors, which are critical pathogenicity and virulence factors, in relationship to population structure. We used genome data from 270 strains from 13 countries for phylogenetic analysis and characterization of Xop effector gene diversity among strains. Our results showed notable genetic diversity in the pathogen. We found genetically similar strains in distant tomato production regions, including seed production regions, and diversification over the past 100 years, which is consistent with intercontinental dissemination of the pathogen in hybrid tomato production chains. Evolution of the Xep pangenome, including the acquisition and loss of type III secreted effectors, is apparent within and among phylogenetic lineages. The apparent long-distance movement of the pathogen, together with variants that may not yet be widely distributed, poses risks of emergence of new variants in tomato production.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.03.20.585960", "title": "Rapid evolution of recombination landscapes during the divergence of cichlid ecotypes in Lake Masoko", "authors": "Talbi, M.; Turner, G.

Many unknowns remain regarding how and why recombination landscapes evolve in nature. Here, we reconstruct recombination maps based on linkage disequilibrium and use subsampling and simulations to derive a new measure of recombination landscape evolution: the Population Recombination Divergence Index (PRDI). Using PRDI, we show that fine-scale recombination landscapes differ substantially between two cichlid fish ecotypes of Astatotilapia calliptera that diverged only ~2,500 generations ago. Perhaps surprisingly, recombination landscape differences are not driven by divergence in terms of allele frequency (FST) and nucleotide diversity ({Delta}({pi})): although there is some association, we observe positive PRDI in regions where FST and {Delta}({pi}) are zero. We found a stronger association between evolution of recombination and 47 large haplotype blocks that are polymorphic in Lake Masoko, cover 21% of the genome, and appear to include multiple inversions. Among haplotype blocks, there is a strong and clear association between the degree of recombination divergence and differences between ecotypes in heterozygosity, consistent with recombination suppression in heterozygotes.

Traditional studies have often overlooked these differences due to the technical challenges of compartment specific analysis. In this study, we employ a robust RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) approach, using microfluidic devices, to generate high-quality axonal transcriptomes from iPSC-derived cortical neurons (CNs). We achieve high specificity of axonal fractions, ensuring sample purity without contamination. Comparative analysis revealed a unique and specific transcriptional landscape in axonal compartments, characterized by diverse transcript types, including protein-coding mRNAs, RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs), mitochondrial-encoded RNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Previous works have reported the existence of transcription factors (TFs) in the axon. Here, we detect a set of TFs specific to the axon and indicative of their active participation in transcriptional regulation. To investigate transcripts and pathways essential for central motor neuron (MN) degeneration and maintenance we analyzed KIF1C-knockout (KO) CNs, modeling hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a disorder associated with prominent length-dependent degeneration of central MN axons. We found that several key factors crucial for survival and health were absent in KIF1C-KO axons, highlighting a possible role of these also in other neurodegenerative diseases. Taken together, this study underscores the utility of microfluidic devices in studying compartment-specific transcriptomics in human neuronal models and reveals complex molecular dynamics of axonal biology.

This study examines the modulation of microsaccadic rates by different stimulus categories.

Neural data showed that category classification in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex peaks earlier than microsaccade rates, suggesting a feedback mechanism from the IT cortex that influences eye movements after stimulus discrimination.

In this study, we introduce a data-driven yet interpretable approach for identifying patterns of cell organizations in the tumor microenvironment that are associated with patient prognoses. Our methodology relies on the construction of a bi-level graph model: (i) a cellular graph, which models the intricate tumor microenvironment, and (ii) a population graph that captures inter-patient similarities, given their respective cellular graphs, by means of a soft Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel. This systematic integration of information across different scales enables us to identify patient subgroups exhibiting unique prognoses while unveiling tumor microenvironment patterns that characterize them. We demonstrate our approach in a cohort of breast cancer patients and show that the identified tumor microenvironment patterns result in a risk stratification system that provides new complementary information with respect to standard stratification systems.

The prokaryotic CNBD channel SthK offers a valuable model for investigating this allosteric mechanism. In this study, we investigated the conformational dynamics and energetics of the SthK C-terminal region using a combination of steady-state and time-resolved transition metal ion Forster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) experiments. We engineered donor-acceptor pairs at specific sites within a SthK C-terminal fragment by incorporating a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid donor and metal ion acceptors.

The probability distributions between conformational states without and with ligand were used to calculate the changes in free energy ({Delta}G) and differences in free energy change ({Delta}{Delta}G) in the context of a simple four-state model. Our findings reveal that cAMP binding produces large structural changes, with a very favorable {Delta}{Delta}G. In contrast to cAMP, cGMP behaved as a partial agonist and only weakly promoted the active state.

These trends are consistent in a case study of adult moyamoya disease. In our small adolescent cohort, macrovascular-microvascular relationships for velocity/delay and flow/CVR change with age, though underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our work emphasizes the need to better characterize this key stage of human brain development, when cerebrovascular hemodynamics are changing, and standard imaging methods offer limited insight into these processes. We provide important normative data for future comparisons in pathology, where combining macro- and microvascular assessments may better help us prevent, stratify, and treat cerebrovascular disease.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.04.26.591310", "title": "Site saturation mutagenesis of 500 human protein domains reveals the contribution of protein destabilization to genetic disease", "authors": "Beltran, T.; Jiang, X.; Shen, Y.; Lehner, B.", "author_corresponding": "Ben Lehner", "author_corresponding_institution": "Wellcome Sanger Institute", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "genomics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.04.26.591310.source.xml", "abstract": "Missense variants that change the amino acid sequences of proteins cause one third of human genetic diseases1.

This age-related susceptibility extends to murine models, where weanling mice (3 weeks old) succumb to LACV infection, while adults (>6 weeks old) demonstrate resistance. Despite its clinical relevance, the host immune response to LACV is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), cytokines, and chemokines in weanling and adult mice following infection with 500,000 plaque forming units (PFU) of LACV. We observed significant age-related differences in viral titers and survival. Weanling mice demonstrated early disease onset with elevated peripheral viremia, but passive transfer of adult serum, confirmed to have nAbs, to naive weanlings prior to infection completely rescued them from death. Cytokine and chemokine profiling revealed distinct kinetics and age-specific immune responses. Adult mice had increased Th1 cytokines, Th9/Th17/Th22/Treg cytokines, and many chemokines. In contrast, weanlings had higher Th2 cytokines, correlating with symptoms onset. Flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining further demonstrated that weanling mice produced higher levels of IL-4 by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to adults, regardless of infection status. Conversely, LACV-infected adult mice had increased IFN-g; production by CD8+ T cells compared to uninfected adults. Finally, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from immune adult mice to naive weanlings delayed neurological symptoms and improved survival, highlighting the protective role of immune adult cells against LACV. In conclusion, this study links nAbs and cytokine and chemokine responses to protective immunity in adult mice, contrasting with the pathogenesis seen in weanlings.

These methods have prompted the development of statistical models to suit with specific sampling designs and get reliable ecological inferences. Site occupancy models estimate species occurrence patterns, accounting for the possibility that the target species may be present but unobserved. Here, two key processes are crucial: detection, when a species leaves signs of its presence, and identification where these signs are accurately recognized. While both processes are prone to error in general, wrong identifications are often considered as negligible with in situ observations. When applied to passive bio-monitoring data, characterized by datasets requiring automated processing, this second source of error can no longer be ignored as misclassifications at both steps can lead to significant biases in ecological estimates. Several model extensions aim to address these potential errors. We propose an extended occupancy model that accounts for the identification process in addition to detection. Similar to other recent attempts to account for false positives, our model may suffer from identifiability issues, which usually require another source of data with perfect identification to resolve them. As an alternative when such data are unavailable, we propose leveraging existing knowledge of the identification process within a Bayesian framework by incorporating this knowledge through an informative prior. Through simulations, we compare different prior choices that encode varying levels of information, ranging from cases where no prior knowledge is available, to instances with accurate metrics on the performance of the identification, and scenarios based on generally accepted assumptions. We demonstrate that, compared to using a default prior, integrating information about the identification process as a prior reduces bias in parameter estimates. Overall, our approach mitigates identifiability issues, reduces estimation bias, and minimizes data requirements.

With advancements in genotyping, early diagnosis is now possible, potentially introducing earlier treatment. However, the intricate structure of muscle and its myriad proteins make treatment predictions challenging. Here we approach the problem of estimating therapeutic targets for a mutation in mouse muscle using a spatially explicit half sarcomere muscle model. We selected 9 rate parameters in our model linked to both small molecules and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. We then randomly varied these rate parameters and simulated an isometric twitch for each combination to generate a large training dataset. We used this dataset to train a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), a technique used in Bayesian parameter estimation. Given simulated or experimental isometric twitches, this machine learning model is able to then predict the set of rate parameters which are most likely to yield that result. We then predict the set of rate parameters associated with twitches from control mice with the cardiac Troponin C (cTnC) I61Q variant and control twitches treated with the myosin activator Danicamtiv, as well as model parameters that recover the abnormal I61Q cTnC twitches.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMachine learning techniques have potential to accelerate discoveries in biologically complex systems.

Placental epigenetic reprogramming associated with FGR may mediate these long-term outcomes. Placental malaria (PM), characterized by sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in placental intervillous space, is the leading global cause of FGR, but its impact on placental epigenetics is unknown. We hypothesized that placental methylomic profiling would reveal common and distinct mechanistic pathways of non-malarial and PM-associated FGR. Results: We analyzed placentas from a US cohort with no malaria exposure (n = 12) and a cohort from eastern Uganda, a region with a high prevalence of malaria (n = 12). From each site, 8 cases of FGR (defined as birth weight <10%ile for gestational age by Intergrowth-21 standard curves) and 4 healthy controls with normal weight were analyzed. PM was diagnosed by placental histopathology. We compared the methylation levels of over 850K CpGs of the placentas using Infinium MethylationEPIC v1 microarray. Non-malarial FGR was associated with 65 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs), whereas PM-FGR was associated with 133 DMCs, compared to their corresponding controls without FGR. One DMC (cg16389901, located in the promoter region of BMP4) was commonly hypomethylated in both groups. We identified 522 DMCs between non-malarial FGR vs. PM-FGR placentas, which was independent of differing geographic location or cellular composition.

While adaptation is studied extensively in the context of motor control, there is limited evidence that cognitive functions such as working memory are subject to the same error-driven adaptive control mechanism. To examine the possibility that internal spatial representations undergo adaptation, we had participants perform a task that interleaved a perceptual discrimination task and a spatial working memory task. Perceptual discrimination trials (85% of trials) presented an initial peripheral cue to exogenously capture attention, immediately followed by a displaced target stimulus. This sequence of events served to repeatedly induce a covert attentional allocation error. Interleaved spatial working memory trials (15% of trials) presented a stimulus at a pseudorandom peripheral location followed by a delay interval. On half of the working memory trials, the stimulus was surreptitiously presented at the same location as the initial attentional cue. We found that as attentional errors accumulated over the course of the experiment, participants' spatial recall shifted to counteract the attentional error. The magnitude of this shift was proportional to the number of induced errors. Recall performance rapidly recovered following the offset of error trials. Multiple control experiments ruled out alternative explanations for these results, such as oculomotor confounds and attentional biases unrelated to error.

Over the last half-century, attempts have been made to elucidate these mechanisms in vivo, primarily focusing on the motor unit (MU) activity because of its role as the smallest voluntarily contractible unit. Although it is firmly established that the nervous system controls muscle force by modulating MU activity, it is yet possible to distinguish between the activities of slow- and fast-twitch MUs non-invasively, which is important for rehabilitation and diagnostic purposes. Although different methods exist to extract MU twitch parameters from a force signal, no method can accurately identify a single MU twitch given a single MU spike train. We addressed this problem by developing a model-based deconvolution method. We evaluated the method using a MU-based recruitment model under isometric contractions and tested it on experimental data. We found that the deconvolution method can provide non-biased average twitch parameter estimates with low variance for the latest recruited MUs, irrespective of contraction level. It can estimate average twitch parameters when the underlying MUs comprise unequal successive twitch profiles, the force signal has lower signal-to-noise ratios, or when the spike train includes missed firings at the cost of slightly increased bias or variance. Finally, the method provides twitch parameter estimates that align with the expected MU recruitment characteristics in experimental conditions.

A striking example of somatic evolution is the VEXAS (Vacuoles E1 enzyme X-linked Autoinflammatory Somatic) syndrome, caused by somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), inducing treatment-refractory, systemic inflammation. However, the mechanisms that lead to survival and expansion of mutant HSCs are unknown, limiting the development of effective therapies. The lack of animal or cellular models of UBA1-mutant HSCs has hindered such mechanistic understanding, mandating analysis of primary human VEXAS samples, which harbor admixtures of wild-type and UBA1-mutant HSCs. To address these challenges, we applied single-cell multi-omics to comprehensively define mutant UBA1-induced transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and signaling pathway alterations in VEXAS patients, allowing for the direct comparison of mutant versus wild-type cells within the same environment. We confirmed the expected enrichment of UBA1M41V/T mutations in myeloid cells, and additionally discovered that these mutations were also prevalent in Natural Killer (NK) cells in VEXAS patients, providing new insights into disease phenotypes. Through mapping genotypes to molecular phenotypes, including transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, cell surface protein or intracellular protein profiles, in HSCs, we found that UBA1M41V/T-mutant cells showed an increased inflammation signature (interferon alpha and gamma response pathways), as well as activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) via pro-survival, but not pro-apoptotic, mediators of the PERK pathway, compared to UBA1 wild-type HSCs. Ex vivo validation experiments showed that inhibiting UBA1 in normal CD34+ or using UBA1-mutant HSCs led to PERK pathway up-regulation, increased myeloid differentiation and cell survival, which was reversed by PERK inhibition. Thus, we demonstrated that human VEXAS HSCs show cell-intrinsic inflammatory phenotypes and survive the proteomic stress caused by compromised ubiquitination through PERK-mediated activation of the UPR. Together, these analyses nominate PERK pathway inhibition as a potential new therapeutic strategy for eradicating the VEXAS-inducing clone, demonstrating the power of single-cell multi-omics profiling of primary patient sample to enable genotype-to-phenotype somatic mapping for the discovery of novel candidates for clinical intervention.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.05.20.595075", "title": "Discriminating neural ensemble patterns through dendritic computations in randomly connected feedforward networks", "authors": "Somashekar, B.

Local convergence of such patterned activity as synaptic clusters on dendrites could help single neurons harness the potential of dendritic nonlinearities to decode neural activity patterns. We combined theory and simulations to assess the likelihood of whether projections from neural ensembles could converge onto synaptic clusters even in networks with random connectivity. Using rat hippocampal and cortical network statistics, we show that clustered convergence of axons from 3-4 different co-active ensembles is likely even in randomly connected networks, leading to representation of arbitrary input combinations in at least ten target neurons in a 100,000 population. In the presence of larger ensembles, spatiotemporally ordered convergence of 3-5 axons from temporally ordered ensembles is also likely.

This measure is inexpensive, non-invasive, and has provided invaluable insights on a wide range of mental processes, from attention to emotion and executive functions. Two outstanding limitations of current pupillometry research are the lack of consensus in the analytical approaches, which vary wildly across research groups and disciplines, and the fact that, unlike other neuroimaging techniques, pupillometry lacks the dimensionality to shed light on the different sources of the observed effects. In other words, pupillometry provides an integrated readout of several distinct networks, but it is unclear whether each has a specific fingerprint, stemming from its function or physiological substrate. Here we show that phasic changes in pupil size are inherently low-dimensional, with modes that are highly consistent across behavioral tasks of very different nature, suggesting that these changes occur along pupillary manifolds that are highly constrained by the underlying physiological structures rather than functions. These results provide not only a unified approach to analyze pupillary data, but also the opportunity for physiology and psychology to refer to the same processes by tracing the sources of the reported changes in pupil size in the underlying biology.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/595554v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14625b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@557201org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1afae2forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d4a717_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Significance statementPhasic changes in pupil size are thought to reflect dynamic shifts between attentional states as instantiated by the locus-coeruleus noradrenaline system, and are crucial for adaptive behaviors. We found that the latent space of these changes is low-dimensional and remarkably similar across very different tasks, involving distinct cognitive processes. We therefore introduce the notion of pupillary manifolds as latent spaces that subtend the generative processes behind these changes.

Ex vivo acute striatal brain preparations are widely employed to study the regulation of evoked DA release but exhibit very different DA release kinetics than in vivo recordings. To investigate the relationship between phasic and tonic neuronal activity, we stimulated the slice in patterns intended to mimic tonic activity, which were interrupted by a series of burst stimuli. Conditioning the striatal slice with low-frequency activity altered DA release triggered by high-frequency bursts and produced kinetic parameters that resemble those in vivo. In the absence of applied tonic activity, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists had no significant effect on neurotransmitter release driven by repeated burst activity in the striatal brain slice. In contrast, in tonically stimulated slices, D2 receptor blockade decreased the amount of DA released during a single burst and facilitated DA release in subsequent bursts.

Chronic pain-related memory impairment has susceptible and unsusceptible features.

RNA-seq analysis and gain/loss-of-function study revealed that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is a determinant for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment. Knockdown of the S1PR1 in the DG promoted a susceptible phenotype and led to structural plasticity changes of reduced excitatory synapse formation and abnormal spine morphology as observed in susceptible mice, while overexpression of the S1PR1 and pharmacological administration of S1PR1 agonist in the DG promoted an unsusceptible phenotype and prevented the occurrence of memory impairment, and rescued the morphological abnormality. Finally, GO enrichment analysis and biochemical evidence indicated that down-regulation of S1PR1 in susceptible mice may impair DG structural plasticity via interaction with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement-related signaling pathways including Itga2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade.

The reliability of these IDPs has been extensively explored, mainly focusing on the inter-subject variations, whereas the stability of the within-subject variations has often been overlooked. Additionally, how environmental factors such as time of day and daylight hours impact the structural brain is poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to assess the stability of T1w-derived phenotypes and explore the effects of time of day and daylight hours. Three subjects in their late 20s, early 30s, and early 40s were scanned repeatedly on the same scanner over one year, from which a densely sampled dataset was acquired with 38, 40, and 25 sessions for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The temporal stability was evaluated using within-subject percentage change and coefficients of variance (CV). The effects of time of day and daylight hours were assessed by fitting general linear models, aggregating the effect size with meta-analysis, and equivalent analysis. The majority of IDPs demonstrated percentage changes within 5% and CVs within 2% for the majority of brain regions, indicating fairly high stability. Interestingly, we found that the brain region size is negatively correlated with the CVs. Specifically, several small brain regions, including the temporal pole, frontal pole, pericalcarine, entorhinal cortex, and accumbens area, showed low stability. In addition, cortical thickness change was strongly and positively correlated with that of volume change while being negatively correlated with change in surface area, illustrating their distinct roles in brain anatomy. Moreover, the time of day could be ignored when evaluating the total surface area and total cortical brain volume but not average cortical thickness since we cannot rule out there is no actual time-of-day effect on it. Furthermore, daylight hours could be left out when evaluating IDPs since there is no appreciable effect of daylight hours on IDPs.

But identification of the EZ with iEEG remains challenging in many cases. We developed a novel methodology using a stacked random forest ensemble machine learning model integrating power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high gamma frequencies over time to identify the EZ.

Additionally, electrodes within the EZ in patients that became seizure-free after surgery had significantly higher AUC compared to electrodes marked within the EZ in patients who did not become seizure-free after surgery in the gamma (p = 0.0145) and high gamma (p = 0.0024) power ranges, but not delta (p=0.8678), theta (p=0.4956), alpha (p=0.1320) or beta (p=0.1624) ranges.

Main results: The active paddle array performed nominally when implanted in sheep for over 15 months and no device-related malfunctions were observed. The onboard multiplexer enabled bespoke electrode arrangements across, and within, experimental sessions. We identified stereotyped responses to stimulation in lower extremity musculature, and examined local field potential responses to EES using high-density recording bipoles. Finally, spatial electrode encoding enabled machine learning models to accurately perform EES parameter inference for unseen stimulation electrodes, reducing the need for extensive training data in future deep models. Significance: We report the development and chronic large animal in vivo evaluation of a high-density EES paddle array containing active electronics. Our results provide a foundation for more advanced computation and processing to be integrated directly into devices implanted at the neural interface, opening new avenues for the study of nervous system function and new therapies to treat neural injury and dysfunction.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.06.03.597179", "title": "Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis reveals the regulatory circuitry of myofiber XBP1 during regenerative myogenesis", "authors": "Joshi, A.

For decades, it is thought to be caused by one species of whipworm, Trichuris trichiura. Discrepancies in response rates to benzimidazole treatment for trichuriasis exist across clinical trial reports yet the underlying reasons are unclear, and the emergence of anthelmintic resistance is predicted to be established within the next decade. Here, we present the discovery of a novel Trichuris species, Trichuris incognita, causing trichuriasis, and we investigate variants in context of drug resistance. Combining long- and short- read sequencing approaches, we assembled a high-quality reference genome of Trichuris incognita to construct the species tree of the Trichuris genus using 12434 orthologous groups and we sequenced a total of 747 individual worms which confirmed the phylogenetic placement. Comparative genomic analysis of genes implied in the resistance of either albendazole or ivermectin in helminths revealed a high copy number of the beta-tubulin (TUBB) gene, present in the whole population, compared to the canonical T. trichiura species. A genome wide association study comparing 181 albendazole-ivermectin sensitive to 544 drug non-sensitive worms implied a HERC4 gene with genome wide significance, which has been reported to be downregulated by ivermectin. Our results demonstrate that trichuriasis can be caused by multiple species of whipworm, challenging the long-held belief that it is exclusively due to Trichuris trichiura. This discovery, coupled with decreased sensitivity to the best available anthelmintic treatment -- a combination of albendazole and ivermectin -- marks a significant shift in how we understand and approach whipworm infections.

Photoreceptors are epigenetically unique, because the promoters of the genes required for the development and function of these neurons are hypermethylated in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and hypomethylated in photoreceptors. However, the mechanism responsible for DNA demethylation during the differentiation of RPCs into photoreceptors and its role in photoreceptor development and function were unknown. We hypothesized that the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases plays a key role in this mechanism. To this end, we knocked out all TET genes in RPCs and characterized the TET-deficient and control retinas using various approaches including electron microscopy, electroretinogram (ERG) tests, RNA-seq, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), and 5hmC-Seal. We found that genetic ablation of the TET family prevents demethylation of the promoters of genes essential for rod specification and for rod and cone maturation during the differentiation of RPCs into photoreceptors. Preservation of methylated cytosines in the promoters of these genes significantly reduced their expression, which was confirmed by western blot analysis. This impaired expression leads to the underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in the photoreceptors of TET-deficient retinas, which results in loss of rod and cone function, as assayed by ERG.

This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood--and addressed--as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects--namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution.

Theoretical work to analyze these plasticity models has largely focused on abstract issues, such as the conditions under which they may promote synchronization and the weight distributions induced by inputs with simple correlation structures, rather than on scenarios associated with specific tasks, and has generally not considered dopamine-dependent forms of STDP. In this paper we introduce three forms of dopamine-modulated STDP adapted from previously proposed plasticity rules.

We test the ability of each of the three models to maintain its weights in the face of noise and to complete simple reward prediction and action selection tasks, studying the learned weight distributions and corresponding task performance in each setting. Interestingly, we find that each plasticity rule is well suited to a subset of the scenarios studied but falls short in others.

Vowels elicit early (< 100 ms) sustained processing negativity (SPN) in the auditory cortex that reflects the detection of an acoustic pattern based on the presence of formant structure and/or periodic envelope information (f0) and its transformation into an auditory \"object\". Methods: We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and individual brain models to investigate whether SPN is altered in children with ASD and whether this deficit is associated with impairment in their ability to perceive speech in the background of noise. MEG was recorded while boys with ASD and typically developing boys passively listened to sounds that differed in the presence/absence of f0 periodicity and formant structure. Word-in-noise perception was assessed in the separate psychoacoustic experiment using stationary and amplitude modulated noise with varying signal-to-noise ratio. Results: SPN was present in both groups with similarly early onset. In children with ASD, SPN associated with processing formant structure was reduced predominantly in the cortical areas lateral to and medial to the primary auditory cortex, starting at ~ 150 - 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In the left hemisphere, this deficit correlated with impaired ability of children with ASD to recognize words in amplitude-modulated noise, but not in stationary noise Conclusions: These results suggest that perceptual grouping of vowel formants into phonemes is impaired in children with ASD and that, in the left hemisphere, this deficit contributes to their difficulties with speech perception in fluctuating background noise.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.06.27.601086", "title": "The Amphibian Genomics Consortium: advancing genomic and genetic resources for amphibian research and conservation", "authors": "Kosch, T.

They also serve as essential models for studying broad genomic traits, such as evolutionary genome expansions and contractions, as they exhibit the widest range of genome sizes among all animal taxa and possess multiple mechanisms of genetic sex determination. Despite these features, genome sequencing of amphibians has significantly lagged behind that of other vertebrates, primarily due to the challenges of assembling their large, repeat-rich genomes and the relative lack of societal support. The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, combined with advanced molecular and computational techniques that improve scaffolding and reduce computational workloads, is now making it possible to address some of these challenges. To promote and accelerate the production and use of amphibian genomics research through international coordination and collaboration, we launched the Amphibian Genomics Consortium (AGC, https://mvs.unimelb.edu.au/amphibian-genomics-consortium) in early 2023. This burgeoning community already has more than 282 members from 41 countries. The AGC aims to leverage the diverse capabilities of its members to advance genomic resources for amphibians and bridge the implementation gap between biologists, bioinformaticians, and conservation practitioners. Here we evaluate the state of the field of amphibian genomics, highlight previous studies, present challenges to overcome, and call on the research and conservation communities to unite as part of the AGC to enable amphibian genomics research to leap to the next level.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.06.27.600973", "title": "Phage display enables machine learning discovery of cancer antigen specific TCRs", "authors": "Croce, G.; Lani, R.; Tardivon, D.; Bobisse, S.; de Tiani, M.; Bragina, M.; Perez, M.

The representation of target features is referred to as the \"attentional\" or \"target\" template and is thought to be encoded within an IFJ-visual cortical network (Baldauf & Desimone, 2014; Bichot et al., 2015b). The contents of the template typically contain veridical target information that is used to modulate sensory processing in preparation for guiding attention during search. However, many behavioral studies have shown that target-associated information is used to guide attention, especially when target discrimination is difficult (Battistoni et al., 2017; de Lange et al., 2018; Peelen et al., 2024; Vo et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2023; Zhou & Geng, 2024). Thus, while target-associated information is known to impact search performance, its presence within the IFJ-visual attentional network during the preparatory period has never been demonstrated. Here, we use fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, to test if attentional guidance by target-associated information is explicitly represented in the preparatory period before search begins, either in conjunction with the target or even in place of it. Participants were first trained on four face-scene category pairings after which they completed a cued visual search task for the same faces. Each trial began with a face cue, followed by a delay period, and then a search display with two lateralized faces superimposed on scene images. The critical results showed that while face information could be decoded in the fusiform face area (FFA), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC), during the cue period, face information could not be decoded in any brain regions during the delay period. In contrast, the associated scene was decoded only in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) during the cue period but most importantly, in the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) during the delay period.

The crucial stage of viral infection, regardless of the route taken to enter the host cell, is membrane fusion.

This would allow us to develop a fusion inhibitor that might work against a larger spectrum of enveloped viruses as it does not target any specific viral fusion protein. With this goal, we have designed a novel peptide by modifying a native sequence derived from coronin 1, a phagosomal protein, that helps to avoid lysosomal degradation of mycobacterium-loaded phagosomes.

One such tactic involves acquiring functional copies of host genes encoding cytokines such as IL-6 (HHV-8), IL-10 (HHV-4, HHV-5), and IL-17 (SaHV-2). These viral mimics, or virokines, can bind to cellular receptors, modulating the natural cytokine signaling to manipulate the immune response in favor of the virus or stimulate target cell growth to enhance virus replication. In the course of full-length cDNA sequencing of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) transcripts, a previously unknown highly-spliced gene was discovered in the viral genome predicted to encode a 147 amino acid protein with similarity to vertebrate interleukin-4. The three-intron gene structure was precisely conserved with chicken and other vertebrate IL-4 homologs, and the amino acid sequence displayed structural conservation with vertebrate homologs at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels based on computational modeling. The viral IL-4 gene was subsequently identified in all sequenced ILTV genomes. Phylogenetic analyses, along with the conserved gene structure, suggested direct capture from a Galliformes host. Functionally, an LPS-stimulation assay showed that the expressed viral IL-4 homolog stimulated nitric oxide production in a macrophage cell line at comparable levels to recombinant chicken IL-4. A recombinant virus lacking vIL-4 exhibited slightly higher titers in cell culture compared to the parental strain. In vivo bird studies demonstrated reduced pathogenicity of the vIL-4 knockout compared to wildtype. These results represent the first report of a previously unknown virokine encoded in the ILTV genome expressing a functional IL-4 homolog and virulence factor.\n\nAuthor SummaryHerpesviruses are large DNA viruses, several of which express proteins that are homologous to host cytokines (termed virokines) and are thought to modulate the host immune response in favor of the virus.

Research suggests that a reduction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons' activity in the hippocampus by beta-amyloid peptide (A{beta}) is a crucial trigger for cognitive impairment in AD via hyperexcitability. Therefore, enhancing hippocampal inhibition is thought to be protective against AD. However, hippocampal inhibitory cells are highly diverse, and these distinct interneuron subtypes differentially regulate hippocampal inhibitory circuits and cognitive processes. Moreover, A{beta} unlikely affects all subtypes of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus equally. Hence, identifying the affected interneuron subtypes in AD to enhance hippocampal inhibition optimally is conceptually and practically challenging. We have previously found that A{beta} selectively binds to two of the three major hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes, 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs, but not 3{beta}4-nAChRs, and inhibits these two receptors in cultured hippocampal inhibitory interneurons to decrease their activity, leading to hyperexcitation and synaptic dysfunction in excitatory neurons. We have also revealed that co-activation of 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs is required to reverse the A{beta}-induced adverse effects in hippocampal excitatory neurons. Here, we discover that 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs predominantly control the nicotinic cholinergic signaling and neuronal activity in hippocampal parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) inhibitory interneurons, respectively. Furthermore, we reveal that co-activation of these receptors is necessary to reverse hippocampal network dysfunction and fear memory loss in the amyloid pathology model mice.

While the severe hereditary erythrocytosis mutant R2456H significantly slows down the inactivation of hPIEZO1, the hPIEZO1-R2456H-MDFIC complex shows a more curved and contracted structure with an inner helix twist due to the broken link between the pore lipid and R2456H.

Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically-induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino-acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate \"vectorized\" forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection and reduced hippocampal inflammation.

Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a short oligomer to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the problem of erroneous products can be mitigated if only monomers are activated, such that each ligation involves at least one monomer. Surprisingly, in such systems, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon which has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior, and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers.

Linkage mapping associating dicamba injury with genotype derived from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing identified a single locus in the kochia genome associated with resistance on chromosome 4. A mutant version of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 16 (AUX/IAA16; a gene previously implicated in dicamba resistance in kochia) was found near the middle of this locus in resistant plants. Long read sequencing of dicamba-resistant plants identified a recently inserted Ty1/Copia retrotransposon near the beginning of the second exon of AUX/IAA16, leading to disruption of normal splicing. A molecular marker for this insertion allows for rapid detection of resistance. Stable transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana ectopically expressing the mutant and wildtype alleles of AUX/IAA16 were developed. Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the mutant AUX/IAA16 allele grew shorter roots on control media. However, transgenic root growth was less inhibited on media containing either dicamba (5 M) or IAA (0.5 M) when compared to non-transgenic plants or those expressing the wildtype allele of AUX/IAA16. In vitro assays indicate reduced binding affinity and more rapid dissociation of the mutant AUX/IAA with TIR1 in the presence of several auxins, and protein modeling suggests the substitution of the glycine residue in the degron domain of AUX/IAA16 is especially important for resistance. A fitness cost associated with the mutant allele of AUX/IAA16 has implications for resistance evolution and management of kochia populations with this resistance mechanism.\n\nSignificanceAuxin mimics are amongst the most important herbicides in modern agriculture.

We designed a verbal instruction paradigm where each trial involved novel combinations of multi-component task information. By manipulating three task-relevant factors, we observed multiplexed coding throughout the trial, during both preparation and implementation stages. The temporal profiles were consistent with a hierarchical structure: whereas task information was active in a sustained manner, the coding of more concrete stimulus features was more transient. Data showed both high dimensionality and abstraction, particularly during instruction encoding and target processing. Our results suggest that whenever task content could be recovered from neural patterns of activity, there was evidence of abstract coding, with an underlying geometry that favored generalization.

We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in {beta} cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets and polarized proinflammatory macrophages revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways and a reduction in interferon response after VLX-1005 treatment. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.07.28.605517", "title": "Artifacts in single-cell mitochondrial DNA mutation analyses misinform phylogenetic inference", "authors": "Lareau, C.

Prior work established that heteroplasmic mtDNA variants can be used to delineate clonality in hematopoiesis, but they have limited ability to reconstruct cellular phylogenies. However, a recent report by Weng et al. challenges the current paradigm by describing an unprecedented number of shared mtDNA variants between cells that reportedly resolve high-resolution phylogenetic trees. We re-examined the claims of Weng et al., and identified two major points of concern regarding this unprecedented connectedness. First, shared variants between cells are disproportionately detected in a single molecule per cell, and second, these variants are enriched 10-20-fold at the edges of mtDNA molecules, reminiscent of artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. Further, our analyses show that pruning low support and likely artificial mtDNA variants removes nearly all of the reported phylogenetic structure. Thus, we strongly caution against using mtDNA variant calling workflows that rely on minimal evidence, including the computational pipeline introduced in Weng et al., as variants with high connectedness and low evidence are likely artifacts that lead to the construction of false phylogenies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.07.30.605780", "title": "Second impact of an acute total body irradiation on thymic epithelial cells", "authors": "Namiki, K.; Muramatsu, W.; Miyao, T.; Ishii, H.; Endo, R.; Hagiwara, N.; Miyauchi, M.; Yoshida, M.; Akiyama, N.; Akiyama, T.", "author_corresponding": "Taishin Akiyama", "author_corresponding_institution": "RIKEN", "date": "2024-09-28", "version": "3", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "immunology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/28/2024.07.30.605780.source.xml", "abstract": "The thymus, a crucial organ for T cell development, undergoes transient involution following exposure to sublethal total body irradiation. The impact of sublethal irradiation on the thymus is reportedly bimodal: thymic involution recurs after the recovery of the thymus from the initial impact of acute sublethal irradiation. While the second impact of acute irradiation has been acknowledged for thymocytes, its influence on thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which are crucial for thymic T cell differentiation and selection, remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aim to elucidate this influence. Mice were subjected to acute sublethal total body irradiation, and TECs were evaluated at three distinct time points: during the initial impact, during the recovery phase post-initial impact, and during the second impact phase. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that during the second impact phase, mTECs were reduced, whereas cTECs remained unaffected. Among mTECs, the subset expressing high levels of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 (mTEChi) experienced the most pronounced reduction. RNA sequencing analysis of mTEChi cells at early differentiation stages revealed significant alterations in gene expression profiles during the second impact phase. Notably, gene signatures of tuft-like TECs and Aire-expressing TECs were preferentially influenced in these mTEChi subpopulations. These findings suggest that acute total body irradiation disrupts mTEC frequencies and gene expression in a bimodal manner, possibly compromising thymic functions over extended periods.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.07.30.605829", "title": "An effective model for community-based conservation around authorized fishing settlements inside a devolved Wildlife Management Area in southern Tanzania", "authors": "Duggan, L.

The subjective natural ecosystem integrity index (SNEII) scores obtained represent a holistic indicator of all aspects of land use, wildlife and human activities, which correlated strongly with objective indicators of wild animal community or whole natural ecosystem integrity that were estimated directly from quantitative survey data by the same investigators at the same locations.

Here, we introduce hMFC (Hierarchical Model for Fluctuations in Criterion), a Bayesian framework designed to estimate slow fluctuations in the decision criterion from limited data. We first showcase the importance of considering fluctuations in decision criterion: incorrectly assuming a stable criterion gives rise to apparent history effects and underestimates perceptual sensitivity. We then present a hierarchical estimation procedure capable of reliably recovering the underlying state of the fluctuating decision criterion with as few as 500 trials per participant, offering a robust tool for researchers with typical human datasets. Critically, hMFC does not only accurately recover the state of the underlying decision criterion, it also effectively deals with the confounds caused by criterion fluctuations.

Today, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with nearly 90,000 fatalities each year.\n\nBy analyzing single-cell data from tumor-bearing colorectal cancer model mice with Lphn1 knockout and wild-type Lphn1, we identified five key target genes for anticancer therapy: Ulbp1, Klrk1, Ccl6, Tlr4, Cd48, Prdm5, VSTM2A, RET, OAS2, Hdac11 and Ptchd4, along with their corresponding cell types. Additionally, we discovered tumor-inhibiting cell subpopulations, including Cd244a_T_cells_subcluster_1, Cd48_Cd244a_NK_cells_subcluster_2, and C3_Macrophages_subcluster_1, which are potential candidates for therapeutic intervention. We propose that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) serve as the primary antigen presenters for MHC class I, providing antigens to macrophages, NK cells, and T cells to combat colorectal cancer. From a cellular perspective, the knockout of Lphn1 activates the anti-colorectal cancer functions of subpopulations of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Macrophages enhance antitumor immune activity by engaging the Ulbp1-Klrk1 receptor pair to activate NK cells. Additionally, macrophages activate downstream functions of T cells against colorectal cancer through CD48 signaling. After the knockout of Lphn1, macrophages are recruited by autocrine Ccl6 and Ccl6 secreted by CAFs. They exhibit high expression of Tlr4 and have the potential to transition into M1-type macrophages due to changes in their cellular state. After the knockout of Lphn1, the CAFs were reduced by half. CAFs, which are part of the cell network communication associated with tumor cells, typically play an immunosuppressive role. A reduction by half indicates that the immunosuppression in the Lphn1 knockout group has significantly decreased. This suggests that the efficacy of various cancer immunotherapy drugs can be significantly enhanced.

While these responses are documented, both the duration of the refractory period to repeated stressors and the role of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in specific phases of the glucocorticoid negative feedback are still being clarified. We explored these questions using water vortices as stressors, combined with GR blockage and measurements of whole-body cortisol in zebrafish larvae subjected to single and repeated stress protocols. Cortisol levels were elevated 10 minutes after stress onset and returned to baseline within 30-40 minutes, depending on the stressor strength. In response to homotypic stress, cortisol levels rose above baseline if the second stressor occurred 60 or 120 minutes after the first, but not with a 30-minute interval. This suggests a rapid cortisol-mediated feedback loop with a refractory period of at least 30 minutes. Treatment with a GR blocker delayed the return to baseline and suppressed the refractory period, indicating GR-dependent early-phase feedback regulation. These findings are consistent with mammalian models and provide a framework for further analyses of early-life cortisol responses and feedback in zebrafish larvae, ideal for non-invasive imaging and high-throughput screening.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.10.607181", "title": "The eduWOSM: a benchtop advanced microscope for education and research", "authors": "Carter, N.

However, achieving PARP1 or PARP2-selective inhibitors is difficult due to their close structural homology. Selectivity profiling is typically done with purified proteins, but these lack the complexity of intracellular environments and could therefore be inaccurate. Here, we duplex PARP1 L713F-GFP and PARP2 L269A-mCherry CeTEAM drug biosensors to systematically characterize binding and cell cycle alterations of 27 PARPi at the single cell level. Our results reveal that most PARPi are generally equipotent for both PARPs, including the next-generation drug, senaparib. However, benzimidazole carboxamide (niraparib) derivatives demonstrated PARP1-selective tendencies, while pthalazinones (olaparib) favored PARP2. AZD5305, a reported PARP1-selective inhibitor with characteristics of both series, was the exception and appears [~]1600-fold more potent towards PARP1. In agreement with current understanding, we see that PARP trapping phenotypes positively correlate with PARP1/2 binding potency, while some potent binders, such as veliparib, did not - likely reflecting their allosteric influence on DNA retention. We also assessed the effect of the PARP1/2 active site component, HPF1, on intracellular PARPi binding and see that HPF1 depletion elicits slight deviations in apparent binding potency, while contributing additively to PARP-DNA trapping phenotypes. The PARP1/2 CeTEAM platform thus provides a structural roadmap for the development of selective PARPi and should facilitate the discovery of better targeted therapies.

Previously, we identified two hypermutator Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolates that rapidly develop drug resistance due to transposition of a retrotransposon, Cnl1. Cnl1-mediated hypermutation is caused by a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding a novel RNAi component, Znf3, combined with a tremendous transposon burden. To elucidate adaptative mechanisms following RNAi loss, two bioinformatic pipelines were developed to identify RNAi loss-of-function mutations in a collection of 387 sequenced C. neoformans isolates. Remarkably, several RNAi-loss isolates were identified that are not hypermutators and have not accumulated transposons. To test if these RNAi loss-of-function mutations can cause hypermutation, the mutations were introduced into a non-hypermutator strain with a high transposon burden, which resulted in a hypermutator phenotype. To further investigate if RNAi-loss isolates can become hypermutators, in vitro passaging was performed. Although no hypermutators were found in two C. neoformans RNAi-loss strains after short-term passage, hypermutation was observed in a passaged C. deneoformans strain with increased transposon burden. Consistent with a two-step evolution, when an RNAi-loss isolate was crossed with an isolate containing a high Cnl1 burden, F1 hypermutator progeny inheriting a high transposon burden were identified. In addition to Cnl1 transpositions, insertions of a novel gigantic DNA transposon KDZ1 ([~]11 kb), contributed to hypermutation in the progeny. Our results suggest that RNAi loss is relatively common (7/387, [~]1.8%) and enables distinct evolutionary trajectories: hypermutation following transposon accumulation or survival without hypermutation.\n\nSignificance StatementThere is a dearth of antifungal drugs available to treat Cryptococcus neoformans, a human fungal pathogen of global impact. We previously identified natural hypermutators with a loss-of-function mutation in the RNAi machinery and transposon expansion. Here, we identified several novel natural isolates with RNAi defects, none of which are hypermutators or have undergone transposon expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these isolates can lie on a pathway to hypermutation following introduction of a transposon burden. In addition, a novel DNA transposon class was discovered that contributes to antifungal drug resistance. These findings highlight the importance of transposons in driving rapid adaptation in the absence of RNAi and reveal distinct evolutionary trajectories following RNAi loss, a relatively common event in C. neoformans.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.14.607850", "title": "The OMG dataset: An Open MetaGenomic corpus for mixed-modality genomic language modeling", "authors": "Cornman, A.; West-Roberts, J.; Camargo, A.

Bayesian neural networks offer a powerful strategy to build predictable models from sparse data, and inherently quantify both, aleatoric uncertainties of the data and epistemic uncertainties of the model. Yet, classical Bayesian neural networks ignore the fundamental laws of physics, they are non-interpretable, and their parameters have no physical meaning. Here we integrate concepts of Bayesian learning and constitutive neural networks to discover interpretable models, parameters, and uncertainties that best explain soft matter systems. Instead of training an individual constitutive neural network and learning point values of the network weights, we train an ensemble of networks and learn probability distributions of the weights, along with their means, standard deviations, and credible intervals. We use variational Bayesian inference and adopt an efficient backpropagation-compatible algorithm that approximates the true probability distributions by simpler distributions and minimizes their divergence through variational learning. When trained on synthetic data, our Bayesian constitutive neural network successfully rediscovers the initial model, even in the presence of noise, and robustly discovers uncertainties, even from incomplete data. When trained on real data from healthy and aneurysmal human arteries, our network discovers a model with more stretch stiffening, more anisotropy, and more uncertainty for diseased than for healthy arteries. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian constitutive neural networks can successfully discriminate between healthy and diseased arteries, robustly discover interpretable models and parameters for both, and efficiently quantify uncertainties in model discovery. We anticipate our approach to generalize to other soft biomedical systems for which real-world data are rare and inter-personal variations are large.

We collected data on three mating-system-related characters. We also collected life form data to indirectly distinguish between mixed mating and highly selfing. We estimated speciation and extinction rates for character states, and state transition rates in 27 genera. We find that outcrossing lineages diversify at higher rates than selfing lineages, while the impact of mating systems on speciation is not consistent across genera. Among self-compatible lineages, annuals/short-lived exhibit significantly lower diversification rates than perennials. Models incorporating hidden states often provide a better fit than those without. The results suggest that selfing lineages overall have lower diversification rates.

We investigated the efficiency and contributions of innate and adaptive immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed immune system behavior during co-infection with HIV and organ transplantation. Additionally, we studied therapy methods, such as interferon administration. The developed model can be employed as a framework for simulating other infectious diseases taking into account follow-up immune response.\n\nAuthor summaryDespite the significant progress reached in understanding of COVID-19, traditional methods still struggle to analyze and interpret the extensive and sometimes controversial experimental data on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mathematical and systems biology approaches attempt to address this challenge by developing mathematical models of the immune response. We aimed not only to investigate the disease at a systemic level but also to provide a framework for further research on host-pathogen interactions, both existing and forthcoming. To achieve this, we constructed a model incorporating both innate and adaptive immunity, as well as cellular and humoral components. This together allowed us to conduct a series of in silico experiments, exploring the immune response across various levels and compartments. The results of these investigations offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the immune system and can guide future research and therapeutic strategies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.20.608810", "title": "Plasma Membrane Remodelling in GM2 Gangliosidoses Drives Synaptic Dysfunction", "authors": "Nicholson, A.

Complex GSLs, containing sialic acid residues are known as gangliosides and are highly abundant in the brain. Diseases of ganglioside metabolism often result in severe, early-onset neurodegeneration. The ganglioside GM2 is the substrate of the hydrolytic lysosomal {beta}- hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme and when subunits of this enzyme are non-functional, GM2 lipid accumulates in cells leading to the GM2 gangliosidoses, Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. We have developed high-quality i3Neuron-based models of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, that demonstrate storage of GM2, formation of membrane whorls and accumulation of endolysosomal proteins consistent with disease phenotypes. Importantly, in addition to lysosomal dysfunction, the composition of the plasma membrane (PM) is significantly impacted in these diseases with changes in the abundance of both lipids and proteins. The changes to the PM proteome are driven in part by exocytosis of lysosomal material resulting in the aberrant accumulation of lysosomal proteins and lipids on the cell surface. The altered abundance of GM2 at the PM was striking, bringing the abundance of this precursor lipid up to that of the common neuronal gangliosides. Furthermore, the PM profiling identifies significant changes in synaptic protein abundances with direct functional impact on neuronal activity including rapid electrical firing consistent with neuronal hyperactivity. This work provides mechanistic insights into neuronal dysfunction in the GM2 gangliosidoses and highlights that these are also severe PM disorders.

Several high throughput experiments have demonstrated that despite its idiosyncrasy, epistatic effects exhibit global statistical patterns. Recently, Papkou et. al. constructed a fitness landscape for a 9-base region in the folA gene, which encodes for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in E. coli, and demonstrated that despite being highly rugged, the landscape is highly navigable. In this work, using the folA landscape, we ask two questions: (1) How does the nature of epistatic interactions change as a function of the genomic background? (2) How predictable is epistasis within a gene? Our results show that epistasis is \"fluid\" - the nature of epistasis exhibited by a pair of mutations is strongly contingent on the genetic background. Mutations exhibit one of two binary \"states\": a small fraction of mutations exhibit extremely strong patterns of global epistasis, while most do not. Despite these observations, we observe that the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of a genotype is highly predictable based on its fitness. These results offer a new perspective on how epistasis operates within a gene, and how it can be predicted.\n\nSignificance Statement.How a mutation changes organismal fitness is dependent on the genome in which it occurs. This phenomenon is known as epistasis and makes evolution unpredictable. Recent efforts to understand epistasis have led to the identification of statistical patterns in its manifestations. To study how epistasis operates in protein evolution, we analyze a recently reported landscape which quantifies fitness of [~]260000 sequences of an E. coli gene. We show two previously unknown properties of epistasis: \"fluid\" (epistasis between mutations is controlled via other epistatic interactions) and \"binary\" (only a few mutations exhibit statistical patterns; most do not). This work sheds new light on how epistasis manifests in gene sequences.

This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in proteins derived from 1,990 genes. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity.

Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. The substitution ratios are positively associated with intrinsically disordered regions and genetic polymorphisms in gnomAD, though the polymorphisms cannot account for the substitutions.

Nevertheless, this option was not explored for protein intracellular delivery, and further characterization of the critical parameters governing the association of a lipid-anchored cargo protein to EVs is still needed to confirm the relevance of this anchorage strategy. Therefore, in this work, we have sought to identify these parameters in a precise and quantitative manner, working with bulk and single nanoparticle analysis methods to identify protein loading capacity and subsequent intracellular delivery. Incubation temperature, cargo concentration and Lipid Anchor (LA) structure (lipid nature and PEG size) appeared as critical factors influencing maximal EV loading capacity. Precise control of these parameters enabled to load cargo protein close to EV saturation without hindering cellular delivery. Interestingly, we evidenced that EV isolation process influenced this association. Structural properties of LA influenced not only cargo protein/EV association, but also its intracellular delivery into different carcinoma cell lines.

We demonstrate that the model can recapitulate tumor and CAR T-cell data from imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models. Our results suggest that locally administered CAR T cells will be most successful against slowly proliferating, highly diffusive tumors, which have the lowest average tumor cell density. These findings affirm the clinical observation that CAR T cells will not perform equally across different types of solid tumors, and suggest that measuring tumor density may be helpful when considering the feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy and planning dosages for a particular patient.

Ringed seal abundance was estimated as [Formula] = 592,577 (95% CI: 478,448-733,929), with highest densities near Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, USA. Bearded seal abundance was estimated as [Formula] = 147,421 (95% CI: 114,155-190,380), with highest densities in broken pack ice near Bering Strait. The influence of environmental variables, such as snow depth and ice type, was consistent with prior studies of the species natural history, particularly ringed seals preference for snow of adequate depth for lairs. Our study provides the first comprehensive abundance estimates for ringed and bearded seals in the Chukchi Sea and establishes a reference for monitoring how their populations respond to Arctic warming.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.30.610517", "title": "Integrator complex subunit 12 knockout overcomes a transcriptional block to HIV latency reversal", "authors": "Gray, C.

Combining latency reversal agents (LRAs) with differing mechanisms of action such as AZD5582, a non-canonical NF-kB activator, and I-BET151, a bromodomain inhibitor is appealing towards inducing HIV-1 reactivation. However, even this LRA combination needs improvement as it is inefficient at activating proviruses in cells from people living with HIV (PLWH). We performed a CRISPR screen in conjunction with AZD5582 & I-BET151 and identified a member of the Integrator complex as a target to improve this LRA combination, specifically Integrator complex subunit 12 (INTS12). Integrator functions as a genome-wide attenuator of transcription that acts on elongation through its RNA cleavage and phosphatase modules. Knockout of INTS12 improved latency reactivation at the transcriptional level and is more specific to the HIV-1 provirus than AZD5582 & I-BET151 treatment alone. We found that INTS12 is present on chromatin at the promoter of HIV and therefore its effect on HIV may be direct. Additionally, we observed more RNAPII in the gene body of HIV only with the combination of INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 & I-BET151, indicating that INTS12 induces a transcriptional elongation block to viral reactivation. Moreover, knockout of INTS12 increased HIV-1 reactivation in CD4 T cells from virally suppressed PLWH ex vivo. We also detected viral RNA in the supernatant from CD4 T cells of all three virally suppressed PLWH tested upon INTS12 knockout suggesting that INTS12 prevents full-length HIV RNA production in primary T cells.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.02.610801", "title": "Raffinose induces autophagy to promote plant growth", "authors": "Magen, S.; Daniel, S.; Weiss, S.; Factor, D.

Under stress conditions, growth is usually attenuated in favor of stress response, creating a trade-off between growth and stress. Autophagy is a vital process in eukaryotes, maintaining cellular balance by degrading and recycling cellular components. It is triggered by various nutrient-deprivation conditions and both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Surprisingly, over-expressing autophagy-related genes across multiple plant species resulted in increased plant size, yield, and stress resistance, posing autophagy as a regulator of the stress-growth balance. Yet, the molecular mechanisms governing its induction remain partially understood.\n\nIn the current work, we identified raffinose-a plant-derived sugar known for its role in stress responses-as a novel plant autophagy inducer. Raffinose treatment resulted in increased biomass and yield in an autophagy-dependent manner in several plant species. We also show that raffinose activates autophagy through the SnRK1 kinase complex, independent of TOR signaling, and that raffinose treatment results in increased expression of ATG5 and ATG7. We also point to possible downstream candidates operating autophagy-related biomass accumulation. Our findings offer new perspectives on the role of autophagy in maintaining a balance between plant growth and stress responses, underscoring the significance of raffinose in its regulation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe intricate balance between plant growth and stress responses is crucial for agricultural productivity, particularly as climate change intensifies environmental stressors such as drought and extreme temperatures. Usually, there is a trade-off between growth and stress response. Autophagy--a cellular recycling process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis--plays a pivotal role in this balance. Yet, the molecular mechanisms modulating it are partially understood. Raffinose treatment enhances biomass and yields in various plant species by inducing autophagy.

The SWI has proved difficult to explain via traditional Bayesian models, which predict the opposite effect: expected weight from size (smaller = lighter) should be integrated with felt weight, such that the smaller object should be perceptually lighter. Other authors have proposed that weight and density are combined according to Bayesian principles, or that Bayesian models incorporating efficient coding can predict the SWI via 'likelihood repulsion'. These models, however, have been evaluated only under the narrow conditions of typical SWI stimuli. Here we establish a general model of perceived weight for pairs of objects that differ in weight and / or density and / or size by varying amounts. In a visuo-haptic task, participants (N = 30) grasped and lifted pairs of cubes, and reported their perceived heaviness. We report that the SWI occurs even at very small density differences, repudiating the idea that the illusion requires a significant conflict between expected and felt weight. Across all object pairs, perceived weight was well explained by a model (R2 = .98) that includes a positive influence of both objects' weights and the judged object's density, but a negative influence of the other object's density. Critically, the influence of both densities on perceived weight is strongly modulated by weight difference, being three times as large for zero / small weight differences than large differences. Thus, it is only under the unusual conditions of typical SWI studies that we confuse weight with density to a substantial extent. Unlike existing models, that are inconsistent with our more comprehensive dataset, our model provides a quantitative, accurate and generalised account of weight perception for pairs of objects across various weight and size conditions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.02.610804", "title": "A new Betaflexivirus species in Ferraria crispa plants", "authors": "Dekker, R.

Given that Pg abundance can increase during pregnancy, it is not well known whether Pg-OMV can have deleterious effects on the brain of the developing fetus. We tested this possibility by treating pregnant C57/Bl6 mice with PBS (control) and OMV from ATCC 33277 by tail vein injection every other day from gestational age 3 to 17. At gestational age 18.5, we measured dam and pup weights and collected pup brains to quantify changes in inflammation, cortical neuron density, and Tau phosphorylated at Thr231. Dam and pup weights were not altered by Pg-OMV exposure, but pup brain weight was significantly decreased in the Pg-OMV treatment group. We found a significant increase of Iba-1, indicative of microglia activation, although the overall levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-6, TNF, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF{beta} mRNA transcripts were not different between the treatment groups. Differences in IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF concentrations by ELISA showed IL-6 was significantly lower in Pg-OMV brains. Cortical neuron density was modified by treatment with Pg-OMV as immunofluorescence showed significant decreases in Cux1 and SatB2. Overall Thr231 was increased in pups exposed to Pg-OMV with the appearance of a secondary band of 60 kD.

Hypothalamic hormones arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) regulate physiological states, including water and electrolyte balance, circadian rhythmicity, and defensive behaviors.

However, understanding the integrated role of neurohypophysial hormones is complicated by the cross-reactivity of AVP and OT and their mutual receptor promiscuity. Here, we provide evidence that the effects of neurohypophysial hormones on BNST excitability are driven by input specificity and cell type-specific receptor selectivity. We show that OTR-expressing BNSTDL neurons, excited by hypothalamic OT and AVP inputs via OTR, play a major role in regulating BNSTDL excitability, overcoming threat avoidance, and reducing threat-elicited anxious arousal. Therefore, OTR-BNSTDL neurons are perfectly suited to drive the dynamic interactions balancing external threat risk and physiological needs.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/611656v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c800forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b5cfaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@85324aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a8bb6b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIExogenous and light-evoked vasopressin (AVP) peptide excites neurons of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) via oxytocin receptor (OTR) in male rats\nC_LIO_LIAVP excites OTR- and Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-expressing neurons, most of which are classified as Type III neurons of the BNST\nC_LIO_LIOTR-expressing BNST neurons increase exploration of open spaces and reduce anxious arousal in fear-potentiated startle in male rats\nC_LIO_LIThe dorsolateral BNST receives vasopressinergic inputs from suprachiasmatic, supraoptic, and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus\nC_LIO_LIInternal signal-sensitive hypothalamic inputs directly impact BNST excitability via OTR to balance interoceptive signals and defensive behaviors\nC_LI", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.04.611151", "title": "Discovery of a new Phenuivirus species in Lachenalia plants reveals possible co-evolution between 5' and 3' RNA sequence motifs", "authors": "Dekker, R.

The knowledge behind the changes in the binding affinity can help in understanding the signaling process and designing inhibitors for therapeutic usage. However, accurate prediction of BA for a large number of mutations has been elusive. In this work, for an important calcium binding protein, cardiac Troponin-C, we have developed an integrative modeling approach that combines molecular dynamics (MD) based binding free energy calculations, prediction of plausible mutants using evolutionary information, and an interpretable machine learning model to predict Ca2+ BA for a large number of mutations (seventy-six in all). For the binding free energy calculation, we have used a charge-scaling based MD simulation that considers the polarization in the system, which is critical for divalent ion binding with proteins. The well-known molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) method was used for the binding free energy calculations. The calculated results for twenty-four disease mutants, which are associated with different cardiomyopathies and have experimental binding affinity, are in close agreement with the experimental results. To study other plausible mutations, we have probed the evolutionary landscape of cardiac Troponin-C and used the EVmutation method of Hopf et al.(Nature biotechnology 2017, 35, 128-135) to generate sixty-one additional mutants. Finally, a Support vector regression model was developed for both observed and plausible mutations. Our machine learning model used simple structure and sequence-based descriptors along with MD-based descriptors and gave a mean squared error (MSE) of only 0.16 kcal/mol. Assessment of the contribution of each descriptor shows that the number of water molecules within the Ca2+ binding site, type of amino acid substitution (e.g. polar to hydrophobic reduces the binding affinity), and the distance of mutation with Ca2+ are the most important factors in determining the binding affinity.

Most species harbor microbial symbionts that have the potential to influence these responses. Mutualistic microbial symbionts may provide resilience to environmental change by protecting their hosts from increasing stress. However, environmental change that disrupts these interactions may lead to declines in hosts or symbionts. Microbes preserved within herbarium specimens offer a unique opportunity to quantify changes in microbial symbiosis across broad temporal and spatial scales. We asked how the prevalence of seed-transmitted fungal symbionts of grasses (Epichloe endophytes), which can protect hosts from abiotic stress, have changed over time in response to climate change, and how these changes vary across host species' ranges. Specifically, we analyzed 2,346 herbarium specimens of three grass host species collected over the last two centuries (1824 -- 2019) for the presence or absence of endophyte symbiosis, and evaluated spatial and temporal trends in endophyte prevalence. We found that endophytes increased in prevalence over the last two centuries from ca. 25% prevalence to ca. 75% prevalence, on average, across three host species. We also found that changes in prevalence were associated with observed changes in seasonal climate drivers; notably increasing precipitation corresponding to each host species' peak growing season and changes in off-peak season variability in precipitation. Our analysis performed favorably in an out-of-sample predictive test with contemporary data, however we identified greater local-scale variability in endophyte prevalence in contemporary data compared to historic data, suggesting that model fusion may be an important step moving forward.

We try to answer those questions for the cerebellum, in turn. The cerebellum is formed of repeating cell networks. In the first step, we model the network computation, about 30 million cells, in detail that includes individual anatomical variability. A central proposal is that network computations are the passive, unlearned result of anatomy, counter to 50 years of the idea that computations depend on learned synaptic changes. In the second step, we propose, in principle, how input to a locomotor network may be topographically organised and where output is sent, and how output is coordinated with the output of other networks. We use a model of eel-like swimming to illustrate unconscious control and propagation of skilled motor sequences. Undulating swimming was probably the original vertebrate solution to changing locations. The main structures and organisation of the vertebrate brain are highly conserved across species, suggesting that the original wiring plan of motor control may have been adapted later to other vertebrate phenotypes.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.13.612917", "title": "Practical Media Formulations for Rapid Growth of Lactobacillus iners and Other Vaginal Bacteria", "authors": "Serrador, D.; Campbell, J.

A microbiome dominated by specific anaerobes (e.g., Gardnerella vaginalis) is termed bacterial vaginosis (BV) and is associated with negative health outcomes, while colonization by Lactobacillus species is thought to protect against BV. However, the role of the species Lactobacillus iners in vaginal health is controversial, with evidence that some strains may not protect against BV while others do. To better characterize L. iners strains, their interactions with vaginal bacteria and human cells need to be investigated in vitro, but this has been impeded by the lack of liquid media for rapid L. iners growth. We have developed three liquid media formulations for L. iners growth: Serradors Lactobacilli-adapted Iscoves Medium (SLIM) which leads to robust L. iners growth, a vaginally adapted version of SLIM (SLIM-V) and a chemically defined medium (SLIM-CD). SLIM and SLIM-V lead to dramatically improved L. iners growth compared to previously published formulations and support growth of other vaginal bacteria, including L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri and G. vaginalis. SLIM-CD leads to slower growth but could prove useful for characterizing L. iners nutrient requirements or metabolite production. A modified version of SLIM-V supports growth of human cervical epithelial cells and provides a base for future co-culture work.

However, evidence on how these attentional templates is represented during preparation remains controversial. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an orientation cueing task to isolate preparatory activity from stimulus-evoked responses. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found decodable information of the to-be-attended orientation during preparation; yet preparatory activity patterns were different from those evoked when actual orientations were perceived. When perturbing the neural activity by means of a visual impulse ('pinging' technique), the preparatory activity patterns in visual cortex resembled those associated with perceiving these orientations. The observed differential patterns with and without the impulse perturbation suggest a predominantly non-sensory format and a latent, sensory-like format of representation during preparation. Furthermore, the emergence of the sensory-like template coincided with enhanced information connectivity between V1 and frontoparietal areas and was associated with improved behavioral performance. This dual-format mechanism suggests that during preparation the brain encodes more detailed template information beyond its immediate use, potentially providing advantages for adaptive attentional control. Consistent with recent theories of non-veridical, 'good-enough' attentional template for initial guidance, our findings established a neural basis for implementing two representational formats in different functional states during preparation: a predominantly non-sensory format for guidance and a latent sensory-like format for prospective stimulus processing.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.13.612932", "title": "CD11B+CD36+ cells are bone anabolic macrophages that limit age-associated bone loss", "authors": "Koroth, J.; Karkache, I.

We demonstrate that transplantation of aged male or female bone marrow into young, lethally irradiated male hosts unexpectedly enhances cortical bone mass without impacting cancellous bone. Our single cell RNA-sequencing data show that mice reconstituted with aged bone marrow exhibited subsets of cells marked by CD11B/CD36 expression that demonstrate enhanced production of anabolic cytokines as compared to young counterparts, and that these myeloid subsets exist under conditions of normal physiology in aged mice. Importantly, CD11B+CD36+ cells do not differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro, and CD36 does not mark TRAP+ cells in vivo. Instead, CD36+ cells localize to resorption sites, including within cortical bone defects, suggesting their involvement in cortical bone remodeling and healing. CD11B+CD36+ cells also express elevated levels of bone anabolic WNT ligands, especially Wnt6. In functional assays, we demonstrate that soluble factors produced by CD11B+CD36+ cells enhance osteoblast progenitor commitment, mineralization, and activation of WNT signaling in vitro.

We performed deep phenotyping of individual dopamine system function by combining multiple PET scans, fMRI, and dopaminergic drug administration in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design.

In contrast, dopamine synthesis capacity was linked to the formation of model-based knowledge but not behavioral control. D2/3 receptors also modulated frontostriatal functional connectivity, suggesting they regulate behavioral control by gating prefrontal inputs to the striatum.

Imaging of transgenic reporters in zebrafish documents lateral plate mesoderm cells that emerge lateral of the classic heart field and among a continuous mesothelial progenitor field. Single-cell transcriptomics and trajectories of hand2-expressing lateral plate mesoderm reveal distinct populations of mesothelial and cardiac precursors, including pericardial precursors that are distinct from the cardiomyocyte lineage. The mesothelial gene expression signature is conserved in mammals and carries over to postnatal development. Light sheet-based live-imaging and machine learning-supported cell tracking documents that during heart tube formation, pericardial precursors that reside at the anterior edge of the heart field migrate anteriorly and medially before fusing, enclosing the embryonic heart to form a single pericardial cavity. Pericardium formation proceeds even upon genetic disruption of heart tube formation, uncoupling the two structures. Canonical Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling modulates pericardial cell number, resulting in a stretched pericardial epithelium with reduced cell number upon canonical Wnt inhibition.

The loss of Rb is a key event in the development or progression of many cancers. Essential functions of Rb occur through its pocket domain, which is necessary for regulating binding interactions with E2F transcription factors and transcription repressors that bind via an LxCxE motif. The pocket domain is the most highly-conserved region of the multidomain protein, as well as the most frequent site of mutations. To understand what effects cancer missense mutations have on Rbs pocket domain, we used fluorescence polarization and differential scanning fluorimetry to quantify changes, caused by 75 cancer-associated missense variants, to E2F transactivation domain (E2FTD) binding, LxCxE binding, and changes to the thermostability of the protein. We find that 43% of the missense variants we tested reduce Rb-E2FTD binding. Many of these variants are not located at the E2F binding site, yet they destabilize the fold of the protein and show temperature-sensitive binding effects. We also find that 21% of tested mutations reduce LxCxE binding, and several mutations selectively disrupt either E2FTD or LxCxE binding. Protein X-ray crystallography of four missense variants reveals how different mutations destabilize the protein fold and inhibit E2FTD or LxCxE binding.

While many cardiac cell types can be generated from human pluripotent stem cells, methods to generate Purkinje fiber cells remain limited, hampering our understanding of Purkinje fiber biology and conduction system defects. To identify signaling pathways involved in Purkinje fiber formation, we analyzed single cell data from murine embryonic hearts and compared Purkinje fiber cells to trabecular cardiomyocytes. This identified several genes, processes, and signaling pathways putatively involved in cardiac conduction, including Notch signaling. We next tested whether Notch activation could convert human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to Purkinje fiber cells. Following Notch activation, cardiomyocytes adopted an elongated morphology and displayed altered electrophysiological properties including increases in conduction velocity, spike slope, and action potential duration, all characteristic features of Purkinje fiber cells. RNA-sequencing demonstrated that Notch-activated cardiomyocytes undergo a sequential transcriptome shift, which included upregulation of key Purkinje fiber marker genes involved in fast conduction such as SCN5A, HCN4 and ID2, and downregulation of genes involved in contractile maturation. Correspondingly, we demonstrate that Notch-induced cardiomyocytes have decreased contractile force in bioengineered tissues compared to control cardiomyocytes. We next modified existing in silico models of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes using our transcriptomic data and modeled the effect of several anti-arrhythmogenic drugs on action potential and calcium transient waveforms.

PVH-specific deletion of Crh reduces anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Here we report that manipulation of PVH Crh expression in primary adrenal insufficiency or by dexamethasone (DEX) treatment do not alter mouse anxiety behaviors. In Experiment 1, we compared wildtype (WT) mice to those with primary adrenal insufficiency (MrapKO) or global deletion of Crh (CrhKO). We analyzed behaviors using open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), PVH Crh mRNA expression by spatial transcriptomics, and plasma ACTH and corticosterone after a 15-minute restraint test with ELISAs. EPM analysis showed CrhKO mice were less anxious than WT and MrapKO mice, and MrapKO mice had no distinguishing behavioral phenotype. In Experiment 2, we evaluated HPA axis habituation to chronically elevated Crh expression by comparing mice treated with 5-8 weeks of DEX with those similarly treated followed by DEX withdrawal for 1 week. All mice regardless of genotype and treatment showed no significant behavioral differences. Our findings suggest that reduced anxiety associated with low Crh expression requires extreme deficiency, perhaps outside of those PVH Crh neurons negatively regulated by glucocorticoids.

It involves viral and bacterial infections, with Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) and Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica) as key bacterial pathogens. These bacteria contribute to severe pneumonia and are often found together. A total of 70 bacterial strains were analysed: 48 P. multocida and 22 M. haemolytica, collected from deep nasal swabs or lung and bronchial swabs from affected calves. The bacterial species were confirmed molecularly using PCR, which was also employed to detect antimicrobial resistance and virulence-associated genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the broth microdilution method.\n\nResultsAntimicrobial resistance varied between the two bacterial species studied. The highest resistance in P. multocida was observed to chlortetracycline 79.2% and oxytetracycline 81.3%, while M. haemolytica showed 63.6% resistance to penicillin and tilmicosin. Multidrug resistance among P. multocida was 27.1%, while among M. haemolytica it reached 40.9%. The most commonly observed phenotypic resistance patterns were  chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline in 37.5% of P. multocida and  ceftiofur, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, penicillin, tilmicosin, tulathromycin in 18.2% of M. haemolytica. The highest susceptibility was found for fluoroquinolones: P. multocida demonstrated 91.7% susceptibility to enrofloxacin, while 77.3% of M. haemolytica were susceptible to both enrofloxacin and danofloxacin. Multidrug resistance was detected in 31.4% of all tested strains. MIC50 and MIC90 determinations were performed for all tested antimicrobials. All M. haemolytica contained the lkt, gs60, and gcp genes. P. multocida carried the sodA gene, while the hgbB and ompH genes were present in 37.5% and 20.8% of strains, respectively.

Perception of light quality via specialised photoreceptors signals the availability of sunlight for photosynthesis. Canopy shade is depleted in red (R) and enriched in far-red (FR) light, lowering R:FR ratio, while direct sunlight and sunflecks contain UV-B. The balance of these wavelengths can determine the developmental strategy adopted by seedlings to either avoid shade, via stem elongation, or promote the expansion of photosynthetic organs. How seedlings regulate stomatal movements in different light environments is poorly understood. Using FR and UV-B supplementation to mimic aspects of canopy shade and sunlight respectively, we monitored stomatal apertures in Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledons.

We show that Regiella increases the fitness of its novel host despite decreasing fitness in its native host. Regiella also shows a low level of horizontal transmission.

New sequencing technologies now enable the characterization of nucleotide and structural variations within species. Among them, TE polymorphism is critical to identify as it may influence species adaptation or trigger diseases. Despite the development of numerous bioinformatic programs, identifying the most effective tool is challenging due to non-overlapping results and varying efficiency across studies. Benchmarking efforts have highlighted the limitations of these tools, often evaluated on either real or simulated data. However, real data may be incomplete or contain unannotated TEs, while simulated data may not accurately reflect real genomes. This study introduces a simulation method generating data based on real genomes to control all genomic parameters. Evaluating several TE polymorphic detection tools using data from Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, our study investigates factors like copy size, sequence divergence, and GC content that influence detection efficiency. Our results indicate that only a few programs perform satisfactorily and that all are sensitive to TE and genomic characteristics, that may differ according to the species considered. Using Bos taurus population data as a case study to identify polymorphic LTR-retrotransposon insertions, we found low-frequency insertions particularly challenging to detect due to a high number of false positives.

Previous studies demonstrated that pathogen and AMR indicators from wastewater and manure survive poorly in the environment, suggesting that ecological barriers prevent their dissemination. However, we recently found that these elements can persist below detection levels in low quality TWW-irrigated soil, and potentially proliferate under favorable conditions. This \"under the radar\" phenomenon was further investigated here, in TWW irrigated- and poultry litter-amended lettuce plants, using an enrichment platform that resembles gut conditions, and an analytical approach that combined molecular and cultivation-based techniques. Enrichment uncovered clinically-relevant multidrug resistant pathogen indicators and a myriad of antibiotic resistance genes in the litter amended and TWW-irrigated lettuce that were not detected by direct analyses, or in the enriched freshwater irrigated samples. Selected resistant E. coli isolates were capable of horizontally transferring plasmids carrying multiple resistance genes to a susceptible strain.

In vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, the precise output of the final effectors, the GLI (Glioma-associated-oncogene) transcription factors, depends on the primary cilium. In particular, the formation of the activator form of GLI upon pathway initiation requires its concentration at the distal cilium tip. However, the mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed a real-time imaging assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single particle resolution within the cilium. We observed that GLI2 is a cargo of Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) machinery and is transported with anterograde bias during a restricted time window following pathway activation. Our findings position IFT as a crucial mediator of transcription factor transport within the cilium for vertebrate Hh signaling, in addition to IFTs well-established role in ciliogenesis. Surprisingly, a conserved Hh pathway regulator, the atypical non-motile kinesin KIF7, is critical for the temporal control of GLI2 transport by IFT and the spatial control of GLI2 localization at the cilium tip.

The discrepancy between the highly inducible and locally confined production of itaconate and the broad expression profile of CLYBL across tissues, suggested a role for this enzyme beyond itaconate catabolism. We discovered that CLYBL additionally functions as a metabolite repair enzyme for malyl-CoA, a side-product of promiscuous TCA cycle enzymes. We found that CLYBL knockout cells, accumulating malyl-CoA but not itaconyl-CoA, show decreased levels of adenosylcobalamin and that malyl-CoA is a more potent inhibitor of MCM than itaconyl-CoA.

This ability is known to fluctuate, resulting in periods of effective task focus ( in the zone) and periods of increased performance variability and susceptibility to errors ( out of the zone). Little is known about the oscillatory neural dynamics that underlie each of these states and their transitions during sustained attention tasks. To address this, we had thirty young adults perform the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), during which their EEG and behavioural responses were recorded. States of sustained attention (in vs. out of the zone) throughout the task were identified based on the variance time course of participants reaction times. Out of the zone states were associated with increased errors of commission and reduced perceptual sensitivity compared to in the zone states, as expected. Importantly, a significant decline in theta oscillations at mid-prefrontal regions was found in out of the zone (vs. in the zone) states over a [~]400 ms period around the transition point between stimuli, and the extent of this decline predicted commission errors, RT variability, and response bias. In addition, individual differences in the variability of frontal theta rhythm were associated with RT variability. Finally, participants exhibiting greater theta variability showed a more pronounced decline in perceptual sensitivity when out of the zone and less stable RTs compared to those with lower variability. Our results suggest that states of diminished sustained attention, even during short lapses, are characterized by a reduction in frontal theta activity, and that fluctuations in this rhythm covary with fluctuations in attentional control.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.25.614780", "title": "A Differential Ion Mobility Acoustic Ejection Mass Spectrometer System for Screening Isomerization-Mediating Enzyme Drug Targets", "authors": "bazargan, s.; Liu, C.; Covey, T.; Schneider, B.; Dranchak, P.; Inglese, J.; Janiszewski, J.", "author_corresponding": "samad bazargan", "author_corresponding_institution": "Sciex", "date": "2024-09-28", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "biochemistry", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/28/2024.09.25.614780.source.xml", "abstract": "We report the first implementation of ion mobility mass spectrometry combined with an ultra-high throughput sample introduction technology for high throughput screening (HTS).

Yet, the mechanisms underlying sensory-mnemonic interactions in the hippocampus are poorly understood. Recent work in cortex suggests that a retinotopic code - typically thought to be exclusive to visual areas - may help organize internal and external information at the cortical apex via opponent interactions. Here, we leverage high-resolution 7T functional MRI to test whether a bivalent retinotopic code structures activity within the human hippocampus and mediates hippocampal-cortical interactions. In seven densely-sampled individuals, we defined the retinotopic preferences of individual voxels within the hippocampus and cortex during a visual mapping task, as well as their functional connectivity during independent runs of resting-state fixation. Our findings reveal a robust retinotopic code in the hippocampus, characterized by stable population receptive fields (pRFs) with consistent preferred visual field locations across experimental runs. Notably, this retinotopic code is comprised of roughly equal proportions of positive and negative pRFs, aligning with the hypothesized role of negative pRFs in mnemonic processing. Finally, the signed amplitude of hippocampal pRFs predicts functional connectivity between retinotopic hippocampal and cortical voxels. Taken together, these results suggest that retinotopic coding may scaffold internal mnemonic and external sensory information processing within the hippocampus, and across hippocampal-cortical interactions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.26.615204", "title": "Decoding mEos4b Day-Long Maturation and Engineering Fast Maturing Variants", "authors": "Maity, A.; Glushonkov, O.; Ayala, I.; Tacnet, P.; Wulffele, J.; Frachet, P.; Brutscher, B.; Bourgeois, D.; Adam, V.", "author_corresponding": "Virgile Adam", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institut de Biologie Structurale", "date": "2024-09-28", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/28/2024.09.26.615204.source.xml", "abstract": "The maturation speed of fluorescent proteins is a crucial parameter that influences cellular brightness, effective labeling efficiency and temporal resolution in fluorescence microscopy.

Of the over 1,200 known representatives, many possess potent biological activities, but their drug potential has not been fully realised up until now. A central obstacle is the limited availability of minor withanolides, caused by a lack of knowledge about the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Here, we combine phylogenomics with metabolic engineering to overcome this limitation. By sequencing the genome of the medicinal plant and archetypical withanolide producer ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and comparing the genome sequences of nine Solanaceae species, we discovered a conserved gene cluster for withanolide biosynthesis, consisting of two sub-gene clusters which differ in their expression patterns. To investigate the functions of the encoded enzymes, we established metabolic engineering platforms in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. This allowed us to reconstitute the first three oxidative steps of withanolide biosynthesis, catalysed by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP87G1, CYP88C7, and CYP749B2, leading to the aglycone of the known compound withanoside V.

A major ongoing challenge for animals is to detect and respond to the presence of a variety of pathogens in their environment. However, to date, the links between the sensory system and the response to pathogenic threats remain poorly understood. Here we show that Drosophila larvae use their taste system to detect bacterial peptidoglycans in their environment and respond by modulating the activity of their cellular immune system. We show that specific PeptidoGlycan Receptor Proteins (PGRPs) act in bitter taste neurons, via the IMmune Deficiency (IMD) pathway. These PGRPs mediate signaling in taste neurons and control immune cells production in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The taste-mediated sensing of bacteria in larvae primes the immune system, and improves survival after infection in adult flies. These results demonstrate that sensory inputs such as taste play an important role in protecting animals from bacterial infection by providing a powerful adaptive response to potential pathogens.

We applied these methods to evaluate condensation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein under GSK3 inhibitor treatment, which we had previously identified in our HCS campaign to induce condensation with well-defined structure-activity relationships (SAR). Using htSMT, we observed robust changes in N protein diffusion as early as 3 hours post GSK3 inhibition. Proximity-based N biosensors also reliably reported on condensation, enabling the rapid assaying of large compound libraries with a readout independent of imaging.

Interspecific hybridization can facilitate adaptation to novel or extreme environments. However, predicting the long-term fitness effects of hybridization remains a major challenge in evolutionary and conservation biology. Experimental evolution with microbes provides a powerful tool for tracking adaptive processes across hundreds of generations in real time. Here, we investigated thermal adaptation dynamics of four species of budding yeast (Saccharomyces) and their interspecific F2 hybrids, for 200 generations under extremely cold (5{degrees}C) and warm (31{degrees}C) conditions. We found significant variation in the evolutionary potential of species and hybrids. Cold-tolerant species showed larger fitness increases in warm temperature, whereas warm-tolerant species showed larger fitness gains in cold temperature. By far the largest fitness improvements occurred in hybrids, with some populations nearly quadrupling in fitness in the cold environment over the course of experimental evolution. Some hybrids exceeded both their parents in thermal adaptive potential. Reciprocal transplanting of evolved populations from the endpoint of evolution into opposite temperatures revealed that hybrids generally have greater resilience than their parents when challenged with sudden temperature shifts. Our results highlight that hybridization alters the fitness outcomes of long-term adaptation to extreme environments and may render populations more resilient to sudden environmental change, presenting both opportunities and challenges for conservation and sustainable agriculture.\n\nLay summaryUnderstanding how populations adapt to extreme temperatures is crucial in times of accelerating climate change. Hybridization and genetic exchange between species can help populations adapt to new or extreme environments, but can also have negative effects on fitness. Predicting the long-term effects of hybridization remains challenging for evolutionary biologists. We usually do not know how hybrid offspring respond to future environmental change. Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to provide insight here, because we can observe fitness changes in real-time, across many generations. We tracked the fitness of six species of budding yeast Saccharomyces and their hybrids, over 200 generations in extreme cold (5{degrees}C) and warm (31{degrees}C) conditions. We found that species and hybrids have significantly different abilities to adapt. The largest fitness improvements were observed in hybrid populations, particularly in the cold, where some nearly quadrupled in fitness and exceeded both their parents. When exposing evolved populations to a sudden shift into opposite temperatures, hybrids were more resilient than their parent species. Even after 200 generations of evolution under opposite temperature conditions, hybrids still showed a similar performance to their ancestors. Our results suggest that hybridization can enhance the ability of populations to adapt to extreme environments, offering potential benefits for conservation and agriculture.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615306", "title": "Recurrent introgression and geographical stratification shape Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the Neotropics", "authors": "Avelar-Rivas, J.

Bisulfite conversion combined with short-read whole genome sequencing can capture and quantify the modification at single nucleotide resolution. However, the PCR amplification process could lead to duplicative methylation patterns and introduce 5mC detection bias. Additionally, the limited read length also restricts co-methylation analysis between distant CpG sites. The bisulfite conversion process presents a significant challenge for detecting variant-specific methylation due to the destruction of allele information in the sequencing reads. To address these issues, we sought to characterize the human methylation profiling with the nanopore long-read sequencing, aiming to demonstrate its potential for long-range co-methylation analysis with native modification call and intact allele information retained. In this regard, we first analyzed the nanopore demo data in the adaptive sampling sequencing run targeting all human CpG islands. We applied the linkage disequilibrium (LD) R2 to calculate the co-methylation in nanopore data, and further identified 27,875, 50,481, 26,542 and 51,189 methylation haplotype blocks (MHB) in COLO829, COLO829BL, HCC1395 and HCC1395BL cell lines, respectively. Interestingly, while we found that majority of the co-methylation were in a short range ([&le;]200bp), a small portion (1[~]3%) showed long distance ([&ge;]1,000bp), suggesting potential remote regulatory mechanisms across the genome. To further characterize the epigenetic changes related to transcription factor binding, we profiled the 5mC percentage changes surrounding various motif sites in JASPAR collection and found that CTCF and KLF5 binding sites showed reduced methylation, while FOXE1 and ZNF354A sites showed increased methylation. To further investigate the allele-specific 5mCG in the prostate genome, we designed a target region covering methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk germline variants and generated long reads with adaptive sampling run in the 22Rv1 cell line. To identify the allele-specific methylation in the 22Rv1 cell line, we performed long-read based phasing and compared the 5mCG signals between the two haplotypes. As a result, we identified 6,390 haplotype-specific methylated regions in the 22Rv1 cell line (p-MWU [&le;] 1e-5 and delta [&ge;] 50%). By examining haplotype-specific methylated regions near the phasing variants, we identified examples of allele-specific methylated regions that showed allele-specific accessibility in the ATAC-seq data. By further integrating the ATAC-seq data of 22Rv1, we found that methylation levels were negatively correlated with chromatin accessibility at the genome-wide scale.

The forensic challenge was addressed from two perspectives: using the reduced abundance OTU tables and employing functional annotations.

After OTU selection, we implemented supervised models and conducted 5-fold cross-validation (CV) with a 4:1 training-to-validation ratio in each scenario.

A comprehensive evaluation of the peptide properties at both sequence and structure levels indicates that the artificial conotoxins generated by ConoDL exhibit a certain degree of similarity to natural conotoxins. Furthermore, ConoDL has generated artificial conotoxins with novel cysteine scaffolds.

Its first step is to trigger the proximity between a ubiquitin ligase complex and a target protein through a heterobifunctional molecule, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), leading to the formation of a ternary complex. The properties of protein-protein interactions play an important regulatory role during this process, which can be reflected by binding cooperativity. Unfortunately, although computer-aided drug design has become a cornerstone of modern drug development, the endeavor to model targeted protein degradation is still in its infancy. The development of computational tools to understand the impacts of protein-protein interactions on targeted protein degradation, therefore, is highly demanded. To reach this goal, we constructed a non-redundant structural benchmark of the most updated ternary complexes and applied a kinetic Monte-Carlo method to simulate the association between ligases and PROTAC-targeted proteins in the benchmark. Our results show that proteins in most complexes with positive cooperativity tend to associate into native-like configurations more often. In contrast, proteins very likely failed to associate into native-like configurations in complexes with negative cooperativity. Moreover, we compared the protein-protein association through different interfaces generated from molecular docking. The native-like binding interface shows a higher association probability than all the other alternative interfaces only in the complex with positive cooperativity. These observations support the idea that the formation of ternary complexes is closely regulated by the binary interactions between proteins. Finally, we applied our method to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). We found that their interactions with the ligase are not as similar as their structures. Altogether, our study paves the way for understanding the role of protein-protein interactions in PROTACE-induced ternary complex formation.

Our study reveals that acute response to EGFR/RAS/RAF-pathway inhibition is spatial and culture context specific. In vivo, EGFR mutant tumor xenografts shrink by > 90% following acute EGFRi therapy, and residual tumor cells are associated with dense stroma and have increased nuclear YAP. Interestingly, in vitro EGFRi induced cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells grown in monolayer, while 3D spheroids preferentially die upon inhibitor treatment. We find differential YAP nuclear localization and activity, driven by the distinct culture conditions, as a common resistance mechanism for selective EGFR/KRAS/BRAF pathway therapies. Forced expression of the YAPS127A mutant partially protects cells from EGFR-mediated cell death in spheroid culture. These studies identify YAP activation in monolayer culture as a non-genetic mechanism of acute EGFR/KRAS/BRAF therapy resistance, highlighting that monolayer vs spheroid cell culture systems can model distinct stages of patient cancer progression.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=99 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615226v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd1484org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e15adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13111a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7df6d6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.613548", "title": "Inhibition of FOXM1 synergizes with BCL2 inhibitor Venetoclax in killing non-t(11;14) multiple myeloma cells via repressing MYC pathway", "authors": "Wen, Z.; Janz, S.; Wang, Y.; Katzenellenbogen, B.

FOXM1, a critical forkhead box transcription factor in high-risk and relapsed/refractory MM, represents a promising therapeutic target of MM. We examined the mechanisms underlying the synergies of Venetoclax and NB73 using multi-omics and molecular and cellular biology tools in non-t(11;14) myeloma cell lines with high FOXM1 expression. NB73 induces immediate loss of FOXM1, decreases BCL2 expression, and increases Puma expression in myeloma cells. Venetoclax enhances NB73-induced FOXM1 ubiquitination and degradation. The NB73-Venetoclax combination abrogates the binding of FOXM1 to the promoters of genes in the MYC pathway, such as PLK1, MYC, CDC20, and CCNA2, leading to the repression of the transcription of these MYC pathway genes.

Several studies have shown the cell-intrinsic drivers of RGC degeneration act in a compartment-specific manor. Recently, the transcription factors JUN and DDIT3 were identified as critical hubs regulating RGC somal loss after mechanical axonal injury. It is possible somal DDIT3/JUN activity initiates axonal degeneration mechanisms in glaucoma. Alternatively, DDIT3/JUN may act downstream of inciting degenerative mechanisms and only drive RGC somal loss. The MAP2Ks MKK4 and MKK7 control all JNK/JUN activity and can indirectly activate DDIT3. Furthermore, MKK4/7 have been shown to drive RGC axonal degeneration after mechanical axonal injury. The present work investigated whether JUN and DDIT3, or their upstream activators MKK4 and MKK7, control degeneration of RGC axons and somas after glaucoma-relevant injury. Ddit3/Jun deletion did not prevent axonal degeneration in ocular hypertensive DBA/2J mice but prevented nearly all RGC somal loss. Despite robust somal survival, Ddit3/Jun deletion did not preserve RGC somal viability (as assessed by PERG decline and soma shrinkage) in DBA/2J mice or after glaucoma-relevant mechanical axonal injury. In contrast, Mkk4/7 deletion significantly lessened degeneration of RGC somas and axons, and preserved somal function and size after axonal injury. In summary, activation of MKK4 and MKK7 appears to be the inciting mechanism governing death of the entire RGC after glaucoma-relevant injury; driving death of the RGC soma (likely through activation of DDIT3 and JUN), decline in somal viability, and axonal degeneration via DDIT3/JUN-independent mechanisms.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615240", "title": "The role of ERFVIIs as oxygen-sensing transducers in the evolution of land plant response to hypoxia", "authors": "Dalle Carbonare, L.; van Veen, H.; Shukla, V.; Perri, M.; Bui, L.

We show that PM3b and other PM3 variants localize to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites (EPCS) while AVRPM3b2/c2 localizes to the nucleocytoplasmic space. Additionally, we found that PM3b interacts in planta with AVRPM3b2/c2 through its LRR domain. We further demonstrate that full length PM3b interaction with AVRPM3b2/c2 is considerably weaker than for the isolated PM3b LRR domain or the susceptible PM3 variant PM3CS, indicating that activation of PM3b leads to dissociation of the complex. In line with this: We observed a strong interaction between PM3b and AVRPM3b2/c2 in a P-loop mutant of PM3b which was unable to initiate a cell death response, or when an inactive variant of AVRPM3b2/c2 was used. We propose that PM3b transiently interacts with AVRPM3b2/c2 through residues in the LRR which are conserved among PM3 variants while the amino acids necessary for full activation and cell death signaling are unique to PM3b. Our data suggests that PM3b localization and interaction with AVRPM3b2/c2 differs from other well studied NLRs and further highlights the mechanistic diversity in NLR-mediated responses against pathogens in plants.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615353", "title": "Plant Mobile Domain protein-DNA motif modules counteract Polycomb silencing to stabilize gene expression", "authors": "Pelissier, T.; Jarry, L.; Olivier, M.; Dajoux, G.; Pouch-Pelissier, M.-N.; Courtois, C.; Descombin, J.; Picault, N.; Moissiard, G.; Mathieu, O.", "author_corresponding": "Olivier Mathieu", "author_corresponding_institution": "CNRS - UMR6293", "date": "2024-09-28", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "plant biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/28/2024.09.27.615353.source.xml", "abstract": "In plants and animals, Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are crucial for development, regulating gene expression through H3K27me3 deposition and subsequent gene silencing.

In this study, to determine whether Urechis unicinctus, a sulfur-tolerant organism, retains the memory of previous sulfide stress, we simulated a repetitive sulfide stress/recovery system.

To investigate pericyte responses following acute ablation, we developed a tamoxifen-inducible pericyte ablation model by crossing PDGFR{beta}-P2A-CreERT2 and Rosa26-DTA176 transgenic mouse lines. Using this model, we studied the effects of different tamoxifen doses and conducted histological examinations 15 and 60 days post-injection to assess both short- and long-term impacts of pericyte ablation.

Unveiling how those representation emerge from DMS circuits is crucial for understanding plasticity mechanisms of early adjustments to learning a task. Here, we hypothesized that inhibitory microcircuits formed by local interneurons are responsible for the genesis of early DMS representation and associated task performance.

Rapid and robust transcription of many genes is facilitated by the formation of a poised basal state, in which RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) has initiated transcription, but is paused just downstream of the gene promoter. Neuronal depolarization releases the paused RNAP2 to complete the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Paused RNAP2 release is controlled by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is sequestered into a larger inactive complex containing Hexamethylene bisacetamide inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) under basal conditions. In this work, we find that neuronal expression of HEXIM1 mRNA is highly correlated with human Alzheimers disease pathologies. Furthermore, P-TEFb regulation by HEXIM1 has a significant impact on the rapid induction of neuronal gene transcription, particularly in response to repeated depolarization. These data indicate that HEXIM1/P-TEFb has an important role in inducible gene transcription in neurons, and for setting and resetting the poised state that allows for the robust activation of genes necessary for synaptic plasticity.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=183 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615234v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1549237org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b84a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f17ebdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7c46c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615294", "title": "Charting Cortical-Layer Specific Area Boundaries Using Gibbs Ringing Attenuated T1w/T2w-FLAIR Myelin MRI", "authors": "Autio, J.

Recent studies have delineated many areas by measuring overall cortical myelin content and its spatial gradients using the T1w/T2w ratio MRI in living primates, including humans. While T1w/T2w studies of areal transitions might benefit from using the layer profile of this myelin-related contrast, a significant confound is Gibbs ringing artefact, which produces signal fluctuations resembling cortical layers. Here, we address these issues with a novel approach using cortical layer thickness-adjusted T1w/T2w-FLAIR imaging, which effectively cancels out Gibbs ringing artefacts while enhancing intra- cortical myelin contrast. Whole-brain MRI measures were mapped onto twelve equivolumetric layers, and layer-specific sharp myeloarchitectonic transitions were identified using spatial gradients resulting in a putative 182 area/subarea partition of the macaque cerebral cortex. The myelin maps exhibit unexpectedly high homology with humans suggesting cortical myelin shares the same developmental program across the species. Comparison with histological Gallyas myelin stains explains over 80% of the variance in the laminar T1w/T2w-FLAIR profiles, substantiating the validity of the method.

KS tumors were maintained in 27/28 PDX until experimental endpoint, up to 272 days in the first passage of recipient mice. KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA)+ endothelial cell density increased by a mean 4.3-fold in 14/15 PDX analyzed by IHC at passage 1 compared to respective input biopsies, regardless of implantation variables and clinical features of patients. The Ki-67 proliferation marker colocalized with LANA more frequently in PDXs. Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed increased expression of viral transcripts from latent and lytic gene classes in the PDX. The expanded KSHV+ regions of the PDX maintained signature gene expression of KS tumors, with enrichment in pathways associated with angiogenesis and endothelium development. Cells with characteristics of tumor-associated fibroblasts derived from PDX were propagated for 15 passages. These fibroblast-like cells were permissive for de novo KSHV infection, and one lineage produced CXCL12, a cancer-promoting chemokine. Spatial analysis revealed that fibroblasts are a likely source of CXCL12 signaling to CXCR4 that was upregulated in KS regions.

Here, we model how discrimination ability in one partner coevolves with cooperativeness in the other and analyse the resulting evolutionary trajectories in the mutualism-antagonism continuum.

Structural models of mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) have also been proposed based on characterization of samples by using various advanced techniques. Among these, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) has proven essential for elucidating the lipid distribution within mRNA-LNPs, a factor crucial to both their preparation and efficacy. However, recent findings suggest that the mRNA-LNP samples prepared via commercial microfluidic techniques may contain a substantial fraction of drug-free LNPs, casting doubt on the validity of earlier structural models. In this study, we employed contrast variation SANS to characterize both drug-free LNPs and our mRNA-LNP sample, and quantified the proportion of drug-free LNPs present to be [~]30% in our mRNA-LNP sample using nano flow cytometry. By removing the contributions of drug-free LNPs from the SANS data of our mRNA-LNP sample, we were able to precisely characterize the structure of mRNA-LNPs. Consequently, we proposed structural models for both drug-free LNPs and mRNA-LNPs. Notably, our analysis revealed similar lipid distributions and shell thicknesses between the two particle types, while the solvent content in mRNA-LNPs was significantly higher, leading to a larger core size. This work not only offers a method for accurately characterizing the structure of mRNA-LNPs, but also establishes criteria for selecting appropriate analytical techniques based on the structural parameters of interest. Therefore, our findings hold significant implications for the mechanistic understanding and quality control of mRNA-based vaccines.\n\nSignificancePrecise structural determination of mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) is vital for mechanistic insights into their preparation, delivery, immunogenicity, and storage, which are critical to the development of mRNA-based vaccines. However, most previous studies overlooked the substantial presence of drug-free LNPs within these samples. Here, we identified that approximately 30% of the nanoparticles in our mRNA-LNP sample were drug-free. By integrating contrast variation small angle neutron scattering (SANS) data from both drug-free LNPs and mRNA-LNPs, we developed structural models for both particle types, and provided a guidance for characterization technique selection based on concerned structural features.

Action video gamers often exhibit faster response times and slightly improved accuracy in vision-based sensorimotor tasks. However, the underlying functional and structural changes in the two visual streams of the brain that may be contributing to these cognitive improvements have been unclear. Using functional and diffusion MRI data, this study investigated the differences in connectivity between gamers who play action video games and nongamers in the dorsal and ventral visual streams. We found that action video gamers have enhanced functional and structural connectivity, especially in the dorsal visual stream. Specifically, there is heightened functional connectivity--both undirected and directed--between the left Superior Occipital Gyrus and the left Superior Parietal Lobule during a moving-dots discrimination decision-making task. This increased connectivity correlates with response time in gamers. The structural connectivity, as quantified by diffusion fractional anisotropy and quantitative anisotropy measures of the axonal fiber pathways between the same regions was also enhanced for gamers compared to nongamers. These findings provide valuable insights into how action video gaming can induce targeted neuroplastic changes, enhancing structural and functional connectivity between specific brain regions in the visual processing pathways. These connectivity changes in the dorsal visual stream underpin the superior performance of action video gamers compared to non-gamers in tasks requiring rapid and accurate vision-based decision-making.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615213v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ebf169org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1363d13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e3c08eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176e719_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Impact StatementUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying how observed cognitive alterations due to video game playing are achieved has potential implications for future cognitive training, rehabilitation, and education.

Upon damage of lysosomal membranes and resulting mATG8 recruitment to their surface by CASM, BLTP3A first dissociates from lysosomes but then reassociates with them via an interaction of its LIR motif with mATG8.

This codon usage bias - both in terms of the degree of bias and the identity of codons used - is highly variable, even among closely related species. Within a species, genome-wide codon usage bias reflects a balance between adaptive and non-adaptive microevolutionary processes. Variation in these microevolutionary processes results in across-species variation in codon usage bias. As codon usage bias is tightly linked to important molecular and biophysical processes, it is critical to understand how changes to these processes drive changes to the microevolutionary processes. Here we employ a population genetics model of coding sequence evolution to quantify natural selection and mutation biases on a per-codon basis and estimate gene expression levels across the budding yeasts Saccharomycotina subphylum. We interrogate the impact of variation in molecular mechanisms hypothesized to be driving the microevolution of codon usage. We find that natural selection and mutation biases evolved rapidly over macroevolutionary time, with high variability between closely related species. The majority (324/327) of yeasts exhibited clear signals of translational selection, with selection coefficients being correlated with codon-specific estimates of ribosome waiting times within species. Across species, natural selection on codon usage correlated with changes to ribosome waiting times, indicating that tRNA pool evolution is a major factor driving changes to natural selection on codon usage. We find evidence that changes to tRNA modification expression can contribute to changes in natural selection across species independent of changes to tRNA gene copy number, suggesting tRNA modifications also play a role in shaping natural selection on codon usage.

We began by identifying derived SNPs with the potential to alter secondary structures within coding regions, using a combination of computational prediction and empirical data analysis. We then examined nucleotide diversity and allele frequencies of these \"pair-changing mutations\" (pcM) in 1,001 A. thaliana genomes to infer selective pressures on these sites. The pcM SNPs at synonymous sites had an 8.8% reduction in nucleotide diversity relative to non-pcM SNPs at synonymous sites, and they were found at lower allele frequencies. We used demographic modeling to estimate selection coefficients from the pcM allele frequency spectrum, finding that pcMs had estimated selection coefficients [~]3 to 5x smaller than nonsynonymous mutations. Additionally, we explored associations of pcMs with bioclimatic variables and gene expression. They exist at higher frequencies in higher latitudes and colder environments, with mean annual temperature explaining 51% of the variation in pcM frequency among subpopulations. Alleles containing pcMs had an average reduction of 137.4 normalized counts compared to genes with the ancestral secondary structure (mean expression = 3215.7 normalized counts).

Current approaches relying on costly iterations of mutation and selection are limited to reactions with a straightforward experimental readout and struggle to address mutational epistasis. We focus on unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs), prized engineering targets due to their ability to oxyfunctionalize diverse organic molecules of industrial and environmental value. To address the lack of scalable screening for UPO functions, we applied enzyme-design calculations to focus experiments. Starting from an AlphaFold2 model of MthUPO, the automated FuncLib algorithm generated 50 diverse active-site multipoint designs--all of which were functional. Screening against nine diverse terpenes revealed large improvements and new oxyfunctionalization products, resulting in molecules of high pharmaceutical and industrial value. This work demonstrates that computational design can overcome the shortcomings of traditional enzyme engineering and accelerate the urgently needed green transition of the chemical industry.\n\nBIGGER PICTUREEnzymes enable energy- and resource-efficient chemical reactions and are key players in the drive to a sustainabil chemical industry. But natural enzymes are seldom optimized for industrial use, demanding optimization by enzyme engineers. Traditional enzyme-engineering approaches, however, are typically time-consuming, costly and struggle to address the complexity of implementing multiple mutations in an enzyme active site. To address these challenges, we apply AI-based structure modeling and computational design calculations to the active site of an enzyme belonging to the unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) family, which are highly prized in the synthesis of valuable flavor, fragrance, and medicinal molecules. Strikingly, the 50 active-site designs we tested were all highly functional and many exhibited different activity profiles and the production of commercially valuable molecules.\n\nThis work demonstrates that computational design can complement traditional methods for enzyme engineering to accelerate the urgently needed green transition of the chemical industry.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIOne-shot computational design of 50 functional UPO designs\nC_LIO_LIDiverse oxyfunctionalization products of different terpene substrates\nC_LIO_LIRemarkable improvement in activity, regio-, chemo- and enantioselectivity\nC_LIO_LIValuable production of commercially relevant molecules\nC_LI\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615329v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1619334org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10763a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e6a0aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c3ce2d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615338", "title": "Less is more: Slow-codon windows enhance eGFP mRNA resilience against RNA interference", "authors": "Mueller, J.

ClpP is overexpressed in cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its inhibition leads to the accumulation of damaged respiratory chain subunits and cell death. Conversely, hyperactivating ClpP with small-molecule activators, such as the recently-discovered ONC201, disrupts mitochondrial protein degradation and impairs respiration in cancer cells. Despite its critical role in human health, the mechanism underlying the structural and functional properties of human ClpP remain elusive. Notably, human ClpP is paradoxically activated by active-site inhibitors. All available structures of human ClpP published to date are in the inactive compact or compressed states, surprisingly even when ClpP is bound to an activator molecule such as ONC201. Here, we present the first structures of human mitochondrial ClpP in the active extended state, including a pair of structures where ClpP is bound to an active-site inhibitor. We demonstrate that amino acid substitutions in the handle region (A192E and E196R) recreate a conserved salt bridge found in bacterial ClpP, stabilizing the extended active state and significantly enhancing ClpP activity. We elucidate the ClpP activation mechanism, highlighting a hormetic effect where sub-stoichiometric inhibitor binding triggers an allosteric transition that drives ClpP into its active extended state. Our findings link the conformational dynamics of ClpP to its catalytic function and provide high-resolution structures for the rational design of potent and specific ClpP inhibitors, with implications for targeting AML and other disorders with ClpP involvement.\n\nSignificance statementHuman ClpP protease is essential for maintaining mitochondrial protein quality by degrading damaged proteins. In cancers like acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ClpP is overexpressed, and inhibiting it causes cancer cell death by disrupting mitochondrial function. Conversely, activating ClpP with small molecules, such as ONC201, also leads to cancer cell death by impairing mitochondrial respiration. However, the structural details of ClpP activation have been elusive. Our research presents the first structures of human ClpP in its active state, revealing a novel activation mechanism where inhibitors unexpectedly trigger activity through allosteric changes.

To overcome this limitation, we have developed a genetically encoded fluorescent protein-based biosensor for malonyl-CoA that can be used to capture malonyl-CoA dynamics in single cells.

Lipid composition impacts fusion through direct protein lipid interactions or through modulating the physical properties of membranes at the site of contact, including the induction of positive curvature by lysophospholipids (LPLs). The degree of positive curvature induced is due to the length and saturation of the single acyl chain in addition to the size of the head group. Here we examined how yeast vacuole fusion and ion transport were differentially affected by changes in lysolipid properties. We found that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) with acyl chains containing 14-18 carbons all inhibited fusion with IC50 values ranging from [~]40-120 {micro}M. The monounsaturation of LPC-18:1 had no effect when compared to its saturated counterpart LPC-18:0. On the other hand, head group size played a more significant role in blocking fusion as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-18:1 failed to fully inhibit fusion. We also show that both Ca2+ uptake and SNARE-dependent Ca2+ efflux was sensitive to changes in the acyl chain length and saturation of LPCs, while LPA only affected Ca2+ efflux. Finally, we tested these LPLs on vacuole acidification by the V-ATPase. This showed that LPC-18:0 could fully inhibit acidification whereas other LPCs had moderate effects. Again, LPA had no effect. Together these data suggest that the effects of LPLs were due to a combination of head group size and acyl chain length leading to a range in degree of positive curvature.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.28.615569", "title": "Tris inhibits a GH1 \u03b2-glucosidase by a linear mixed inhibition mechanism", "authors": "Chagas, R.

Such inhibition mechanism implies in the formation of a non-productive ESI complex involving Sf{beta}gly, substrate and Tris. In addition, Tris binding reduces by 3 fold the enzyme affinity for the substrate. Hence, at concentrations higher than the Ki, Tris can completely abolish Sf{beta}gly activity, whereas even at lower concentrations the presence of Tris causes underestimation of {beta}-glucosidase kinetic parameters (Km and kcat). In agreement to the inhibition mechanism, computational docking showed that Tris could bind to a pocket placed at the lateral of the active site opening in the Sf{beta}gly-substrate complex, hence leading to the formation of a ESI complex. Computational docking also showed that Tris may find binding spots in the interior of the active site of the Sf{beta}gly and several GH1 {beta}-glucosidases. Moreover, the variety of their active site shapes results in a multiplicity of binding profiles, foreseeing different inhibition mechanism.

Craig Venter Institute, have enabled the creation of the first cell driven by synthetic genome and opened a new era of creating designer microbes. This technology offers far greater potential for genetic modification than traditional genome editing techniques and holds promise for the routine creation of synthetic cells as DNA synthesis costs decrease and genetic knowledge expands. Two essential technologies underpin this achievement: the ability to clone entire genomes in host organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the successful transplant of these genomes into recipient cells to generate living organisms. In all previous work the recipient cell in genome transplantation experiments has been Mycoplasma capricolum. In this study, we explored the potential of using Mycoplasma mycoides strains as recipient cells for genome transplantation. By increasing polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration from 5% to 10%, we successfully transplanted various M. mycoides strains using several M. mycoides recipient cells. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability to transplant M. capricolum genomes into M. mycoides recipient cells; although with lower efficiency compared to M. mycoides strains. These findings provide a modified transplantation protocol and likely get us closer to expanding genome transplantation to other bacterial species.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.26.615247", "title": "Comparative Analysis of AAV Serotypes for Transduction of Olfactory Sensory Neurons", "authors": "Belfort, B.

Minocycline MICs against 10 AB strains were compared in standard bacteriologic media (Mueller-Hinton broth, MHB) and physiologic (RPMI) media. Macrophages were pretreated with minocycline or comparator antibiotics before AB co-culture. Macrophage cytokine production and phagocytosis of AB were measured without and with pre-treatment with minocycline. Two to eight-fold reduction in minocycline MIC against 10 AB strains occurred in RPMI compared to MHB, which was more pronounced than other antibiotic classes. Macrophages pretreated with 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, and 100 g/mL minocycline before bacterial co-cultures significantly decreased AB inoculum at 6 hours of co-culture in a dose-dependent manner, with no bacterial colonies observed from co-cultures with macrophages pretreated with 30 g/mL or more of minocycline. Macrophages pretreated with minocycline for 24 hours before zymosan stimulation led to significantly higher levels of phagocytosis. Macrophages treated with minocycline for 24 hours significantly decreased production of IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 in a dose dependent manner. The minocycline in vivo efficacy may be attributed to enhanced activity in nutrient-limited, physiologic medium combined with increased macrophage phagocyte efficiency.

Changes in the faecal microbial composition and a reduction in species diversity (dysbiosis) are consistent features in studies of Crohns disease patients, but whether dysbiosis is a cause or consequence of inflammation remains unresolved. Genetic susceptibility also plays a role in the development of Crohns disease and has been linked to genes involved in recognition of intestinal bacteria by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The earliest visible lesions in Crohns disease are aphthous ulcers, overlying Peyers patches and lymphoid follicles. To identify mechanisms underlying the earliest stages of disease initiation we compared gene expression in aphthous ulcers, Peyers patches, inflamed and endoscopically normal mucosa from patients and controls using total RNA-seq.\n\nThe resulting data was subjected to network analysis to identify co-regulated gene expression signatures of cell types and processes. These results were compared to recent single cell RNA-seq analysis of intestinal macrophages in normal and diseased mucosa. The analysis of aphthous ulcers revealed signatures of epithelial stress and antimicrobial defence, plasma cell activation and immunoglobulin production, monocyte recruitment, inflammatory gene expression and induction of interferon-{gamma} and downstream target genes. These signatures were not present in the normal appearing mucosa adjacent to aphthous ulcers which were similar to healthy control mucosa.\n\nWe conclude that the initial lesion in Crohns disease arises from an invasive bacterial challenge leading to intense activation of multiple host defence pathways rather than the breakdown of epithelial barrier integrity and widespread bacterial translocation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615498", "title": "Genome-directed study uncovers a family of phospholipases and highlights the diversity of Salmonella T6SS effectors.", "authors": "Nicastro, G.

Previous studies highlighted the importance of Salmonella T6SSs in bacterial antagonism and host cell infection, but few antibacterial effectors have been described. Here, we used bioinformatic strategies to identify the T6SS effectors in 10,000 Salmonella genomes. As a result, we identified and manually curated 128 candidates. Specific Salmonella serovars harbor unique effectors that are target-specific (antibacterial or anti-eukaryotic), depending on the T6SS subtype (e.g. i1 or i3). In addition, 45 previously uncharacterized toxin domains were identified and designated STox (Salmonella toxins). STox15 was among the most frequent candidates and was selected for in-depth characterization. STox15 is an antibacterial effector belonging to the NlpC/P60 papain-like fold superfamily with a permuted catalytic core typical of lipid-targeting versions rather than peptidases or amidases. Biochemical analysis with recombinant protein and lipidomics of intoxicated Escherichia coli revealed that STox15 displays phospholipase activity cleaving off acyl groups from phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that most analyzed strains (88%) produced tailocins. Tailocin-mediated killing interactions were assessed across 351 strain pairs, showing that Dickeya spp. had a higher incidence of killing (57.1%) than Pectobacterium spp. (21.6%). Additionally, Dickeya spp. strains exhibited inter-genus activity, targeting both Pectobacterium spp. and Musicola sp., while Pectobacterium spp. tailocins were genus-specific. A so-called \"bilateral killing\" was observed in 33.9% of interactions, predominantly within Dickeya spp. Although tailocins were morphologically indistinguishable between producer strains, genomic analyses identified conserved tailocin gene clusters across both genera, with distinct structural differences between Pectobacterium spp. and Dickeya spp tailocins. This suggests different origins of these particles.

Bradyzoite stage parasites, which establish a new infection in a naive host, must also use motility to escape from the cysts that are ingested by the new host and then migrate to the gut wall, where they either invade cells of the intestinal epithelium or squeeze between these cells to infect the underlying connective tissue. We know very little about the motility of bradyzoites, which we analyze in detail here and compare to the well-characterized motility and motility-dependent processes of tachyzoites. Unexpectedly, bradyzoites were found to be as motile as tachyzoites in a 3D model extracellular matrix, and they showed increased invasion into and transmigration across certain cell types, consistent with their need to establish the infection in the gut. The motility of the two stages was inhibited to the same extent by cytochalasin D and KNX-002, compounds known to target the parasites actomyosin-based motor. In contrast, other compounds that impact tachyzoite motility (tachyplegin and enhancer 5) have less of an effect on bradyzoites, and rapid bradyzoite egress from infected cells is not triggered by treatment with calcium ionophores, as it is with tachyzoites. The similarities and differences between these two life cycle stages highlight the need to characterize both tachyzoites and bradyzoites for a more complete understanding of the role of motility in the parasite life cycle and the effect that potential therapeutics targeting parasite motility will have on disease establishment and progression.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615519", "title": "Accurate quantitation of 16S gene copies in low biomass samples post-antibiotic treatment through deep sequencing with a balanced nucleotide synthetic spike-in approach", "authors": "Chang, C.-C.; Huang, L.; Jin, Y.; Jamal, M.

In the absence of Ing4, we show that MPPs express a transcriptional program of hematopoietic activation, yet they remain quiescent with low levels of reactive oxygen species. Functionally, Ing4-deficient MPPs are capable of robust regeneration following competitive bone marrow transplantation, resulting in substantially higher blood chimerism compared to wild-type MPPs.

Approximately 90% of patients carry a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium ion channel, NaV1.1. The NaV1.1 channel is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. Previous studies have identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which specifically downregulates SCN1A gene expression. This natural antisense transcript (NAT) can be modulated by AntagoNATs, small synthetic oligonucleotides developed to inhibit NAT function. In a DS mouse model, AntagoNATs were shown to modulate Scn1a expression by targeting the Scn1a NAT, improving seizure frequency after repeated administration. Here, we have developed novel AntagoNATs and incorporated these into a clinically relevant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy vector, to test in a DS mouse model (Scn1a+/-) and provide a one-off treatment approach.\n\nEighteen AntagoNATs were tested in vitro; from the best performing candidates, we selected two AntagoNAT sequences (K & H) for in vivo testing as they had the highest homology (90%) to human SCN1A NAT. We administered both vectors to newborn Scn1a+/- mice via intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravenous (IV) injection to target the brain and heart. AAV9-AntagoNAT-H significantly increased survival, decreased febrile seizures and reduced spontaneous seizure frequency compared to the PBS control group. When administered at P14 by ICV and IV injection, AAV9-AntagoNAT-H increased survival. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated for the first time the delivery of AntagoNAT technology via an AAV9 vector and thus offering the possibility of a one-time treatment for DS patients.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615459", "title": "Outer membrane changes enable evolutionary escape from bacterial predation", "authors": "Mridha, S.; Loose, S.-L.; Mattmann, O.

Not only must these materials reach the appropriate cellular locale fully intact and in therapeutically relevant concentrations, they must also retain activity upon arrival. The question of residual activity is especially critical when delivery involves exposure to the late endocytic pathway, whose acidic lumenal environment can denature and/or degrade internalized material. ZF5.3 is a compact, stable, rationally designed mini-protein that efficiently escapes intact from late endocytic vesicles, with or without covalently linked protein cargo. Here, using insights from mechanistic studies on the pathway of endosomal escape and classic knowledge regarding the bioinorganic chemistry of zinc(II) coordination in small proteins, we re-designed the sequence of ZF5.3 to successfully alter the timing (but not the efficiency) of endosomal escape. The new mini-protein we describe, AV5.3, escapes earlier than ZF5.3 along the endocytic pathway with no loss in efficiency, with or without enzyme cargo. More importantly, earlier endosomal escape translates into higher enzymatic activity upon arrival in the cytosol. Delivery of the pH-sensitive protein dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) with AV5.3 results in substantial catalytic activity in the cytosol, whereas delivery with ZF5.3 does not. The activity of AV5.3-DHFR upon delivery is sufficient to rescue a genetic DHFR deletion in CHO cells. This work provides evidence that programmed trafficking through the endosomal pathway is a viable strategy for the efficient cytosolic delivery of therapeutic proteins.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=69 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615476v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@28852eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fa4a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@516c1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@190aebd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.26.615289", "title": "Efficient degradation of oxidized polyethylene containing ester bonds by cutinase or lipase in aqueous phase", "authors": "Kong, D.; Wang, L.; Xia, W.; Shi, M.; Wu, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jing Wu", "author_corresponding_institution": "Jiangnan University", "date": "2024-09-28", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "biochemistry", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/28/2024.09.26.615289.source.xml", "abstract": "Polyethylene is a widely used plastic that presents challenges in degrading within natural environments.

Translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pol) are often more promiscuous than DNA Pols, raising the notion that reverse transcription could be performed by a TLS Pol. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that human Pol {eta} has reverse transcriptase activity, while others have suggested that the yeast TLS Pol {zeta} is involved. Here, we purify all seven known nuclear DNA Pols of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and compare their reverse transcriptase activities. The comparison shows that Pol {zeta} far surpasses Pol {eta} and all other DNA Pols in reverse transcriptase activity. We find that Pol {zeta} reverse transcriptase activity is not affected by RPA or RFC/PCNA and acts distributively to make DNA complementary to an RNA template strand.

Nuclear RNA interference is a unique process that triggers regulation through epigenetic alterations to the genome. This pathway has been extensively characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans and involves the nuclear recruitment of H3K9 histone methyltransferases by the Argonautes HRDE-1 and NRDE-3. The coordinate regulation of genetic targets by H3K9 methylation and the nuclear Argonautes is highly complex and has been mainly described based on the small RNA populations that are involved.\n\nRecent studies have also linked the nuclear RNAi pathway to the compaction of the hermaphrodite X chromosomes during dosage compensation, a mechanism that balances genetic differences between the biological sexes by repressing X chromosomes in hermaphrodites. This chromosome-wide process provides an excellent opportunity to further investigate the relationship between H3K9 methylation and the nuclear Argonautes from the perspective of the transcriptome. Our work suggests that the nuclear RNAi and the H3K9 methylation pathways each contribute to the condensation of the X chromosomes during dosage compensation but the consequences on their transcriptional output are minimal. Instead, nuclear RNAi mutants exhibit global transcriptional differences, in which HRDE-1 and NRDE-3 affect expression of their native targets through different modes of regulation and different relationships to H3K9 methylation.\n\nARTICLE SUMMARYThis study examines the transcriptional consequences during the disruption of the nuclear RNAi silencing mechanism in C. elegans. Through microscopy and bioinformatic work, we demonstrate that although nuclear RNAi mutants exhibit significantly decondensed X chromosomes, chromosome-wide transcriptional de-repression is not detectable.

In line with this, RNA-sequencing of total tongue RNA from 4NQO-treated mice revealed Aim2-/- mice had enhanced expression of genes related to the MHC protein complex, cell killing, and T cell activation compared to wild type mice. In addition, we observed increased macrophage infiltration into the tongue epithelium of 4NQO-treated Aim2-/- mice. Lastly, using Aim2-/-/Rag1-/--double deficient animals, we found that the adaptive immune compartment was necessary for the enhanced tumorigenesis during AIM2 deficiency. Taken together, these findings suggest AIM2 limits the progression of oral tumor development partially through regulating IFN{gamma} and adaptive immune responses.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.26.614592", "title": "PRMT1 Modulates Alternative Splicing to Enhance HPV18 mRNA Stability and Promote the Establishment of Infection", "authors": "Williams, D.

Thus, understanding the virus-host interplay that influences the establishment of viral infection has important implications for HPV biology and human cancers. The ability of papillomaviruses to establish in cells requires the strict temporal regulation of viral gene expression in sync with cellular differentiation. This control primarily happens at the level of RNA splicing and polyadenylation. However, the details of how this spatio-temporal regulation is achieved still need to be fully understood.\n\nUntil recently, it has been challenging to study the early events of the HPV lifecycle following infection. We used a single-cell genomics approach to identify cellular factors involved in viral infection and establishment. We identify protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as an important factor in viral infection of primary human cervical cells. PRMT1 is the main cellular enzyme responsible for asymmetric dimethylation of cellular proteins. PRMT1 is an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the methylation of arginine residues on various proteins, which influences processes such as RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. In this study, we show that HPV18 infection leads to increased PRMT1 levels across the viral lifecycle. PRMT1 is critical for the establishment of a persistent infection in primary cells. Mechanistically, PRMT1 inhibition leads to a highly dysregulated viral splicing pattern. Specifically, reduced PRMT1 activity leads to intron retention and a change in the E6 and E7 expression ratio. In the absence of PRMT1, viral transcripts are destabilized and subject to degradation via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. These findings highlight PRMT1 as a critical regulator of the HPV18 lifecycle, particularly in RNA processing, and position it as a potential therapeutic target for persistent HPV18 infections.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615321", "title": "Inter-kingdom signaling by the Legionella autoinducer LAI-1 involves the antimicrobial guanylate binding protein GBP", "authors": "Solger, F.; Rauch, J.; Vormittag, S.; Fan, M.; Raykov, L.; Charki, P.; Soldati, T.; Seibel, J.; Hilbi, H.", "author_corresponding": "Hubert Hilbi", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Z\u00fcrich", "date": "2024-09-28", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/28/2024.09.27.615321.source.xml", "abstract": "The causative agent of Legionnaires disease, Legionella pneumophila, is an amoebae-resistant environmental bacterium, which replicates intracellularly in a distinct compartment, the \"Legionella-containing vacuole\" (LCV). L. pneumophila employs the -hydroxyketone compound LAI-1 (Legionella autoinducer-1) for intra-species and inter-kingdom signaling. LAI-1 promotes intracellular replication and inhibits the migration of mammalian cells and Dictyostelium discoideum. In this study, we revealed that LAI-1 and \"clickable\" azido-LAI-1 derivatives inhibit the migration of D. discoideum and localize to LCVs. Azido-LAI-1 colocalizes with the LCV markers calnexin, P4C, and AmtA, but not with mitochondrial or lipid droplet markers. Intriguingly, LAI-1 dependent inhibition of D. discoideum migration involves the single guanylate-binding protein (GBP), a member of the GBP family of large GTPases, which in metazoan organisms promote cell autonomous immunity. D. discoideum lacking GBP ({Delta}gnbp) allows more efficient intracellular replication of L. pneumophila, without apparently compromising LCV remodeling or integrity, and GBP-GFP localizes to the ER at LCV-ER membrane contact sites (MCS). However, the peri-LCV localization of LAI-1 and GBP is not mutually dependent. Synthetic LAI-1 inhibits the expansion/remodeling of LCVs (but not vacuoles harboring avirulent L. pneumophila) in a GBP-dependent manner. Taken together, the work shows that LAI-1 localizes to LCVs, and LAI-1-dependent inter-kingdom signaling involves D. discoideum GBP, which localizes to LCV-ER MCS and acts as an antimicrobial factor by restricting the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila.\n\nAuthor SummarySmall molecule inter-kingdom signaling between pathogens and host cells represents a crucial but only partly understood aspect of microbial virulence. The amoeba-resistant opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila employs the compound LAI-1 (Legionella autoinducer-1) for intra-species and inter-kingdom signaling. In metazoan cells, the conserved and wide-spread family of guanylate-binding protein (GBP) large GTPases usually comprises several distinct paralogues, which are implicated in pathogen detection, inflammation, cell death pathways, and cell autonomous immunity. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, only a single GBP gene of unknown function is present. Using approaches from organic chemistry, genetics, cell biology and infection biology, we reveal that GBP is involved in the inhibition of D. discoideum migration and pathogen vacuole expansion/remodeling by LAI-1 as well as in intracellular growth of L. pneumophila.

Deletion of ugpE did not affect bacterial growth but impaired cell chain formation and capsular synthesis by downregulating the mRNA levels of the capsular regulon genes cps-2B, cps-2C, and cps-2S. Deletion of ugpE also led to decreased tolerance to heat, oxidative, and acid-base stress. Crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated ugpE negatively regulated biofilm formation in liquid culture and the rdar biofilm morphotype on agar plates. Moreover, ugpE deletion not only reduced hemolysin activity, survival in whole human blood, and anti-phagocytosis ability against porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) but also enhanced bacterial adhesion and invasion of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) by upregulating the expression of multiple genes associated with cell adhesion.

After a two-week social isolation stress period, mice were required to explore a box arena that had thermal threat and safety zones (5{degrees}C vs 30{degrees}C, respectively).

This has led to unprecedented advancement of gene editing for therapeutic benefit. Initial uses of CRISPR/Cas9 were focused on gene disruption via DNA cleavage, but significant engineering led to systems for single base editing as well as insertion, deletion and manipulation of short stretches of genomic sequences using nicking Cas9 and RT-based methods. These technologies allowed safer and more precise editing but were limited to small corrections and showed significantly reduced efficiencies in nondividing cells, presenting difficulty for translation to in vivo therapies. To find an alternate editing strategy that could address these shortcomings, we revisited the mechanism of DNA nicking by nCas9. nCas9 nicking creates a free 5 phosphate group and a 3 hydroxyl group on the complementary strand of the target sequence. Under ordinary conditions in the cell these ends are re-joined by endogenously expressed ligases to repair DNA back to wild-type. If, however, a DNA fragment containing the desired edit were present, ligation of the nicked genomic DNA with the delivered fragment could result in gene editing. We demonstrate that optimization of each component and introduction of a chemically modified high affinity splinting DNA allows a variety of ligase-based edits, including longer edits not efficient with RT-based systems, at high efficiencies and fidelities that minimize genomic byproducts in both dividing and nondividing cells as well as in vivo in adult mice.

We observed that mothers engaging in low maternal care (LMC) displayed lower adult neurogenesis in both the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus compared to high maternal care (HMC) mothers. We then observed that LMC-reared pups exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviour at postnatal day (PND) 5, 9, and 22.

However, it is unknown how acute amphetamine affects brain areas involved in executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex. We studied this problem in mice using interval timing, which requires participants to estimate an interval of several seconds with a motor response. Rodent prefrontal cortex ensembles are required for interval timing. We tested the hypothesis that amphetamine disrupts interval timing by degrading prefrontal cortex temporal encoding.\n\nMethodsWe first quantified the effects of amphetamine on interval timing performance by conducting a meta-analysis of 11 prior rodent studies. We also implanted multielectrode recording arrays in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of 7 mice and then examined the effects of 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine injected intraperitoneally on interval timing behavior and prefrontal neuronal ensemble activity.\n\nResultsA meta-analysis of previous literature revealed that amphetamine produces a large effect size on interval timing variability across studies but only a medium effect size on central tendencies of interval timing. We found a similar effect on interval timing variability in our task, which was accompanied by greater trial-to-trial variability in prefrontal ramping, attenuated interactions between pairs of ramping neurons, and dampened low-frequency oscillations.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that amphetamine alters prefrontal temporal processing by increasing the variability of prefrontal ramping.

The only licensed TB vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, that protects young children from severe disease but fails to provide protection through adulthood. It is unclear why BCG-induced immunity provides incomplete protection despite inducing a robust CD4+ T cell response, a known critical correlate of protection against Mtb. We set out to interrogate mycobacterial determinants of vaccine escape using a functional genomics approach, TnSeq, to define mycobacterial genes required for survival in mice vaccinated with BCG, the live attenuated Mtb vaccine, {Delta}LprG, and in mice with Mtb immunity conferred by prior infection. We find that critical virulence genes associated with acute infection and exponential growth are less essential in hosts with adaptive immunity, including genes encoding the Esx-1 and Mce1 systems. Genetic requirements for Mtb growth in vaccinated and previously Mtb-infected hosts mirror the genetic requirements reported for bacteria grown under in vitro conditions that reflect aspects of the adaptive immune response as well as in mouse genetic backgrounds where bacterial growth is restricted. Across distinct immunization conditions, differences in genetic requirements between live attenuated vaccines and vaccination routes are observed, suggesting that different immunization strategies impose distinct bacterial stressors. Collectively, these data support the idea that Mtb requires genes that enable stress adaptation and growth arrest upon encountering the restrictive host environment induced by the adaptive immune response. We demonstrate that TnSeq can be used to understand the bacterial genetic requirements for survival in vaccinated hosts across pre-clinical live attenuated vaccines and therefore may be applied to other vaccine modalities.

This study delves into the bacterial-fungal dynamics in severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) among 61 children aged 3-4 years with complete deciduous dentition. We evaluated environmental factors such as saliva pH, buffering capacity, and trace elements (iron, fluoride). We examined the performance of 16S rRNA V1-V9 regions gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers for bacteria and fungi from plaque and saliva to characterize community compositions and diversity. Saliva pH and buffering capacity were also measured. Findings revealed significant shifts in bacterial diversity in S-ECC saliva samples, marked by decreased diversity and elevated abundance of cariogenic species, particularly Streptococcus mutans. Candida albicans was notably more prevalent in the S-ECC group, implicating its potential role in pathogenesis. Iron and fluoride concentrations showed no significant correlation with microbial community structure. Network analyses uncovered complex intra- and inter-kingdom interactions, underscoring cooperative and competitive dynamics. S-ECC children exhibited higher abundances of bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Granulicatella, Actinomyces) and fungi (Candida albicans), with specific microbial taxa associated with reduced saliva pH.\n\nImportanceThis study illuminates the intricate relationship between bacteria and fungi within the oral microbial community of children, specifically highlighting differences between those with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and those without caries. Through an extensive analysis of the microbial composition in both saliva and dental plaque, we identified a significant increase in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa (e.g., S. mutans, Granulicatella, Actinomyces) and fungal species (e.g., C. albicans) in the oral cavities of children with S-ECC.

However, it remains unclear how well traits explain variation in the outcomes of current and novel competition, as well as the underlying processes determining coexistence or competitive exclusion, under changing climate. Here, we conducted a field experiment in which pairs of high and low-elevation species interacted in three sites across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps. For each species pair, we quantified the population-level outcomes of competition (invasion growth rates), relative fitness differences and niche overlap and related these to 15 functional traits that were measured in each site. Most traits were significantly associated with invasion growth rates at the low elevation, where species had greater relative fitness differences, but these associations were much weaker towards higher elevations. This appears to be because traits, particularly those associated with light competition, captured species relative fitness differences at lower elevations, but not at the high elevation site. Greater relative fitness differences towards lower elevations suggest that climate warming may increase the likelihood of competitive exclusion of species that are poor competitors for light. In addition, novel competitors tended to show greater niche overlap than current competitors, leading to stronger overall competitive effects. But in general, trait differences predicted competitive outcomes of novel and current competitors similarly well, suggesting that traits can be used to predict interactions between species that do not yet interact.

Our approach, based on prediction of phosphomimetic delta-delta-G from structural features, strongly correlates with experimental mutational scanning cDNA proteolysis data (R = 0.71). We predicted the destabilizing effects of all 384,857 tyrosine residues from the Alphafold2 database. We then applied our approach to a pan-cancer phosphoproteomics dataset, comprising over 600 unique tyrosine phosphorylations across 11 cancer subtypes. We predict destabilizing phosphorylations in both oncogenes and tumor suppressors, where the former likely reflects a generalized relief of auto-inhibition or activating conformational change. We find that the number of circuit topological parallel relations with respect to residues contacting the phosphorylated site is greater for autoinhibited oncogenes than for other proteins (Wilcoxon p = 0.03). Utilizing an extreme gradient-boosting machine learning approach, we obtain an AUC of 0.85 for the prediction of autoinhibited phosphorylation states from circuit topological features. The top destabilized proteins from the pan-cancer data are enriched for chemical and oxidative stress pathways. Among metabolic proteins, highly destabilizing phosphorylations tend to occur in more peripheral proteins with lower network centrality measures (Wilcoxon p = 0.005). We predict 58% of recurrent tyrosine cancer phosphorylations to be destabilizing at the 1 kcal/mol threshold.

Chronic exposure to these stresses contributes to failure of the joint organ system, resulting in pain and loss of function for patients with OA.

Unfortunately, the separate and combined effects of metabolic and biomechanical stresses on synovial tissues are not well understood. In this study, metabolic syndrome (MetS) was associated with worse knee pain in patients with early-stage knee OA, suggesting that metabolic stress may act on synovial tissues during early-stage OA, exacerbating outcomes. In a rat model of experimental knee OA, the combined effects of biomechanical and metabolic stresses induced worse knee pain, cartilage damage, and synovial inflammation than biomechanical stress alone. Further, single-cell RNA sequencing of synovial macrophages and fibroblasts identified earlier metabolic (glycolytic and respiratory) shifts, neurogenesis, dysregulated communication, and cell activation when metabolic and biomechanical stresses were combined. Lastly, using a direct contact co-culture system, we showed that metabolic stress alters macrophage-fibroblast communication leading to increased expression of Htra1, a pathogenic protease in OA.

We find many examples of active compensation, where deletion of one paralog results in increased abundance of another, and collateral loss, where deletion of one paralog results in reduced abundance of another. Compensation is enriched among sequence-similar paralog pairs that are central in the protein-protein interaction network and widely conserved across evolution. Compensation is also significantly more likely to be observed for gene pairs with a known synthetic lethal relationship.

Prior work suggests that individual differences in the spatial organization of functional brain networks across the cortex are associated with psychopathology and differ systematically by sex.\n\nAimsWe aimed to evaluate the impact of sex on the spatial organization of person-specific functional brain networks.\n\nMethodWe leveraged person-specific atlases of functional brain networks defined using non-negative matrix factorization in a sample of n = 6437 youths from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Across independent discovery and replication samples, we used generalized additive models to uncover associations between sex and the spatial layout (\"topography\") of personalized functional networks (PFNs). Next, we trained support vector machines to classify participants sex from multivariate patterns of PFN topography. Finally, we leveraged transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to evaluate spatial correlations between sex differences in PFN topography and gene expression.\n\nResultsSex differences in PFN topography were greatest in association networks including the fronto-parietal, ventral attention, and default mode networks. Machine learning models trained on participants PFNs were able to classify participant sex with high accuracy. Brain regions with the greatest sex differences in PFN topography were enriched in expression of X-linked genes as well as genes expressed in astrocytes and excitatory neurons.\n\nConclusionsSex differences in PFN topography are robust, replicate across large-scale samples of youth, and are associated with expression patterns of X-linked genes.

To address these limitations, we developed and validated a kinematic deviation index (KDI) for rodents that mimics current trends in clinical research. The KDI is a unitless summary score that quantifies the difference between an animal movement during a task and its optimal performance derived from spatiotemporal marker sequences without pre-specifying movements. We demonstrate the utility of KDI in assessing reaching and grasping in mice and validate its discrimination between trial endpoints in healthy animals. Furthermore, we show KDI sensitivity to interventions, including acute and chronic spinal cord injury and optogenetic disruption of sensorimotor circuits.

Furthermore, we showed that specific HDTFs are expressed in distinct newborn neurons and specify different lamina neuron types: Zfh1 for L1 and L3, Dve for L2, and Bsh for L4 and L5.

Approximately half of these isoforms contain TE sequences, and these contribute to half of the novel annotated splice junctions. We quantify splicing of these LR-seq derived isoforms in 1,135 breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1,329 healthy tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and find 300 TE-overlapping tumor-specific splicing events.

Specifically, flies mark a rewarded goal location with self-deposited scents, to which they assign a positive value to, and use these scents and their self-motion cues to guide them back to the goal. This learning process is mediated by the mushroom body(MB) - an olfactory learning center responsible for associating odors with reinforcement3 -and by PFN neurons, which encode egocentric translational velocity4,5, a self-motion cue.

However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered nucleolar organization is poorly understood due to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here, we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. Furthermore, by generating synthetic de novo nucleoli through an engineered rDNA plasmid system in cells, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus.

The transcription factor GmNAC42-1 is an important and direct activator of the biosynthesis of glyceollin phytoalexins in soybean. Yet, without elicitation, overexpressing GmNAC42-1 is insufficient to activate the expression of glyceollin biosynthetic genes, suggesting that the activity of GmNAC42-1 may be suppressed by a negative regulator. JAZ1 proteins are negative regulators of the canonical jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. JAZ protein degradation and JAZ gene transcription comprise antagonistic mechanisms that activate and suppress JA signaling, respectively. In search for negative regulators of glyceollin biosynthesis, we identified by RNA-seq analysis abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and GmJAZ1 genes that are oppositely regulated compared to glyceollin biosynthesis. Long-term ABA treatment upregulated GmJAZ1 transcripts, whereas its biosynthesis inhibitor fully suppressed their upregulation by dehydration stress. Opposite patterns were observed for glyceollin biosynthesis. RNAi silencing of GmJAZ1s prevented the suppression of glyceollin biosynthesis by dehydration and derepressed glyceollin synthesis in non-elicited tissues. Overexpressing GmJAZ1-9 in hairy roots elicited with Phytophthora sojae wall glucan elicitor partially suppressed glyceollin biosynthesis. The GmJAZ1-9 protein physically interacted with GmNAC42-1 and inhibited its transactivation and DNA binding activities in promoter-luciferase and yeast-three hybrid systems. Silencing JAZ1s in Arabidopsis and grapevine has been reported to derepress camalexin and stilbene phytoalexin biosynthesis. Here, we found that JAZ1 and NAC42 proteins from all three plant species physically interact, suggesting a conserved mechanism negatively regulates phytoalexin biosynthesis in plants.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=98 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615281v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf89e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f4dabdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@144ddf8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@48ed70_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615361", "title": "Biologically informed cortical models predict optogenetic perturbations", "authors": "Sourmpis, C.; Petersen, C.

Recently, the Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) method was performed with the G4-specific BG4 antibody to target Tn5 transposase to G4s. While this method generated a novel high-resolution map of G4s, we unexpectedly observed a strong correlation between the genome-wide signal distribution of BG4 CUT&Tag and accessible chromatin. To examine whether untargeted Tn5 cutting at accessible chromatin contributes to BG4 CUT&Tag signal, we examined the genome-wide distribution of signal from untargeted (i.e. negative control) CUT&Tag datasets. We observed that untargeted CUT&Tag signal distribution was highly similar to both that of accessible chromatin and of BG4 CUT&Tag. We also observed that BG4 CUT&Tag signal increased at mapped G4s, but this increase was accompanied by a concomitant increase in untargeted CUT&Tag at the same loci. Consequently, enrichment of BG4 CUT&Tag over untargeted CUT&Tag was not increased at mapped G4s. These results imply that either the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions contain mappable G4s or that the presence of G4s within accessible chromatin cannot reliably be determined using BG4 CUT&Tag alone.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615263v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d0f89org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e72042org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f6dffborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eaf992_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.26.615287", "title": "3D Printing of Multiscale Scaffolds with Microtopography for Guiding Tissue Organization and Regeneration", "authors": "Fu, R.; Jones, E.

These scaffolds induced the simultaneous orientation of vascular endothelial cells along the axial grooves and vascular smooth muscle cells along the circumferential rings, mimicking the orthogonally aligned bilayer architecture of natural arteries.

The movement of the cells is controlled by an acoustically induced vortex flow generated by a microbubble. By modulating the activation of this microstreaming, the cells are shifted either to the upper or lower regions of the channel and directed into a side channel for collection downstream.

Despite this, there is limited understanding of how triple helices, the basic collagen structural units, pack into collagenous assemblies. Here we use a peptide self-assembly system to design collagenous assemblies based on the C1q collagen-like region. Using cryo-EM we solve a structure of one assembly to 3.5 [A] resolution and build an atomic model. From this, we identify a triple helix conformation with no superhelical twist, starkly in contrast to the canonical right-handed triple helix. This non-twisting region allows for unique hydroxyproline stacking between adjacent triple helices and also results in the formation of an exposed cavity with rings of hydrophobic amino acids packed symmetrically. We find no precedent for such an arrangement of collagen triple helices and have designed mutant assemblies to probe key stabilizing amino acid interactions in the complex. The mutations behave as predicted by our atomic model. Our findings, combined with the extremely limited experimental structural data on triple helix packing in the literature, suggest that collagen and collagen-like assemblies may adopt a far more varied conformational landscape than previously appreciated.

Importantly, receipt of 991-exposed CARTs significantly improved in vivo leukemia clearance, prolonged recipient survival, and increased CD4+ T cell yields at early times post-injection. Ex vivo, 991 agonist treatment mimicked nutrient starvation, increased autophagic flux, and promoted generation of mitochondrially-protective metabolites.\n\nDISCUSSIONEx vivo expansion processes are necessary to generate sufficient cell numbers, but often promote sustained activation and differentiation, negatively impacting in vivo persistence and function. Here, we demonstrate that promoting AMPK activity during CART expansion metabolically reprograms cells without limiting T cell yield, enhances in vivo anti-leukemia efficacy, and improves CD4+ in vivo persistence. Importantly, AMPK agonism achieves these results without further modifying the expansion media, changing the CART construct, or genetically altering the cells. Altogether, these data highlight AMPK agonism as a potent and readily translatable approach to improve the metabolic profile and overall efficacy of cancer-targeting T cells.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615365", "title": "A spiking neural network model for proprioception of limb kinematics in insect locomotion", "authors": "van der Veen, T.; Cohen, Y.; Chicca, E.; Du\u0308rr, V.", "author_corresponding": "Thomas van der Veen", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Groningen: Rijksuniversiteit Groningen", "date": "2024-09-29", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/29/2024.09.27.615365.source.xml", "abstract": "Proprioception plays a key role in all behaviours that involve the control of force, posture or movement. Computationally, many proprioceptive afferents share three common features: First, their strictly local encoding of stimulus magnitudes leads to range fractionation in sensory arrays. As a result, encoding of large joint angle ranges requires integration of convergent afferent information by first-order interneurons. Second, their phasic-tonic response properties lead to fractional encoding of the fundamental sensory magnitude and its derivatives (e.g., joint angle and angular velocity). Third, the distribution of disjunct sensory arrays across the body accounts for distributed encoding of complex movements, e.g., at multiple joints or by multiple limbs. The present study models the distributed encoding of limb kinematics, proposing a multi-layer spiking neural network for distributed computation of whole-body posture and movement. Spiking neuron models are biologically plausible because they link the sub-threshold state of neurons to the timing of spike events. The encoding properties of each network layer are evaluated with experimental data on whole-body kinematics of unrestrained walking and climbing stick insects, comprising concurrent joint angle time courses of 6 x 3 leg joints. The first part of the study models strictly local, phasic-tonic encoding of joint angle by proprioceptive hair field afferents by use of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire neurons. Convergent afferent information is then integrated by two types of first-order interneurons, modelled as Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons, tuned to encode either joint position or velocity across the entire working range with high accuracy. As in known velocity-encoding antennal mechanosensory interneurons, spike rate increases linearly with angular velocity. Building on distributed position/velocity encoding, the second part of the study introduces second- and third-order interneurons. We demonstrate that simple combinations of two or three position/velocity inputs from disjunct arrays can encode high-order movement information about step cycle phases and converge to encode overall body posture.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen stick insects climb through a bramble bush at night, they successfully navigate through highly complex terrain with little more sensory information than touch and proprioception of their own body posture and movement. To achieve this, their central nervous system needs to monitor the position and motion of all limbs, and infer information about whole-body movement from integration in a multi-layer neural network. Although the encoding properties of some proprioceptive inputs to this network are known, the integration and processing of distributed proprioceptive information is poorly understood. Here, we use a computational model of a spiking neural network to simulate peripheral encoding of 6 x 3 joint angles and angular velocities. The second part of the study explores how higher-order information can be integrated across multiple joints and limbs. For evaluation, we use experimental data from unrestrained walking and climbing stick insects. Spiking neurons model the key response properties known from their real biological counterparts. In particular, we show that the first integration layer of the model is able to encode joint angle and velocity both linearly and accurately from an array of phasic-tonic input elements. The model is simple, accurate and based, where possible, on biological evidence.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.28.615603", "title": "Phage Steering in the Presence of a Competing Bacterial Pathogen", "authors": "Gurney, J.; Czerwinski, S.

The ability of protozoans to form dormant cysts complicates treatment, as current therapies are ineffective against cyst stages and suffer from poor specificity and side effects. Nitroxoline, a quinoline derivative with well-established antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties, is a promising therapeutic candidate. This study aimed to elucidate cellular signalling events that counteract the effects of nitroxoline. In this study, nitroxoline significantly reduced the viability of A. castellanii trophozoites in a dose- and time-dependent manner, inducing morphological changes and apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed substantial alterations in gene expression, including enrichment of metabolic pathways, DNA damage responses, and iron ion binding. Nitroxoline treatment upregulated genes involved in DNA repair and oxidative stress response while regulating genes in the methionine and cysteine cycles. It also decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, H2S production, and total iron amount in A. castellanii. Bioinformatics analyses and molecular docking studies suggest direct interactions between nitroxoline and A. castellanii proteins. Our research provides a comprehensive molecular map of the response of A. castellanii to nitroxoline, revealing significant changes in gene expression related to the stress response and metabolic pathways.

The current models suggest that heterochromatin is marked by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me), which recruits heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), to compact chromatin and repress transcription. In C. elegans, the SETDB1 homolog MET-2 is essential for H3K9me-mediated gene silencing; however, MET-2 also localizes to heterochromatic foci independently of H3K9me and exhibits non-catalytic functions that support both germline and somatic development. Here we extend these findings by examining the classical H3K9me reader HP1. We show that HPL-2/HP1 deficient in methyl-lysine binding or in the absence of H3K9me can still repress transcription, promote organogenesis and localize to heterochromatin foci. Whereas activity remains in the absence of the HPL-2:H3K9me interaction, complete loss of met-2 and hpl-2 shows synergistic phenotypes for organogenesis and gene de-repression, underscoring the existence of additional, H3K9me-independent functions. HPL-2 and MET-2 require distinct binding partners for their localization and activity: MET-2 associates with the disordered protein LIN-65/ATF7IP, while HPL-2 depends on the multi-zinc finger protein LIN-13, which interacts with the HPL-2 chromoshadow domain.

Our structures reveal a synergistic mechanism underlying the stronger stimulatory effect by H3K14Ub compared to automethylation: site-specific ubiquitination constrained by the H3K14 linkage increases substrate affinity through multivalent interactions between ubiquitin and Clr4. Additionally, H3K14Ub facilitates the allosteric transition of Clr4 from an inactive apo conformation to a hyperactive \"catalyzing state\", accompanied by conformational changes in the C-SET-insertion (SI) region, complete release of the autoregulatory loop (ARL), and retraction of the {beta}9/10 loop.

Comparing genome-wide crossover maps of the mlh1 mutant with ZMM-deficient mutants and lines with varying HEI10 levels reveals that while crossover interference persists in mlh1, it is weakened. Additionally, mlh1 show reduced crossover assurance, leading to a higher incidence of aneuploidy in offspring. This is likely due to MUS81 resolving intermediates without the crossover bias seen in MutL{gamma}. Comparing mlh1 mlh3 mus81 and zip4 mus81 mutants suggests that additional crossover pathways emerge in the absence of both MutL{gamma} and MUS81. The loss of MutL{gamma} can also be suppressed by eliminating the FANCM helicase. Elevated expression of MLH1 or MLH3 increases crossover frequency, while their overexpression significantly reduces crossover numbers and plant fertility, highlighting the importance for tight control of MLH1/MLH3 levels.

MCell simulations indicated that the blockage of Cav3.1 by montelukast reduced the number of synaptic vesicles being released from the pre-synaptic region to the synaptic cleft, which may reduce the probability and amplitude of postsynaptic potentials.\n\nAuthor SummaryNew drugs for current illnesses or disorders are always necessary to enhance therapeutic outcomes or can be utilised for patients who have experienced side effects from current medicines. The Cav3.1 T-type calcium channel has been found to be linked to neurological diseases, such as epilepsy and diabetes. Consequently, identifying a drug that could bind to these receptors may yield therapeutic effects on these neurological conditions. This study utilises various computational methods to sift through 2,115 FDA-approved drugs that have been used for other diseases, not neurological ones, to determine whether some of these drugs could bind to the Cav3.1 T-type calcium channel and potentially produce therapeutic effects on neurological diseases. Our research indicates that the current asthma drug montelukast has the potential to bind to the calcium channel and is worthy of further investigation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.29.615681", "title": "Glutamate Transport Proteins and Metabolic Enzymes are Poor Prognostic Factors in Invasive Lobular Carcinoma", "authors": "Young, T.

We further explore the effects of GLUD1 inhibition in endocrine therapy-resistant ILC cells using the small-molecule inhibitor R162, which reduces ER protein levels, increases reactive oxygen species, and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation.

Weedy rice populations converge in histological features of the abscission zone (AZ), a crucial structure for seed abscission, while ancestral cultivated rice populations exhibit varied AZ morphology and levels of shattering. However, the genetic bases of these phenotypic patterns remain unclear. We examined the expression profiles of the AZ region and its surrounding tissues at three developmental stages in two low-shattering cultivars of aus and temperate japonica domesticated varieties and in two genotypes of their derived high-shattering weed groups, Blackhull Awned (BHA) and Spanish Weedy Rice (SWR), respectively. Consistent with the greater alteration of AZ morphology during the de-domestication of SWR than BHA, fewer genes exhibited a comparable AZ-region exclusive expression pattern between weed and crop in the japonica lineage than in aus lineage. Transcription factors related to the repression of lignin and secondary cell deposition, such as, OsWRKY102 and OsXND-1-like, along with certain known shattering genes involved in AZ formation, likely played a role in maintaining AZ region identity in both lineages. Meanwhile, most genes exhibiting AZ-region exclusive expression patterns do not overlap between the two lineages and the genes exhibiting differential expression in the AZ region between weed and crop across the two lineages are enriched for different gene ontology terms. Our findings suggest genetic flexibility in shaping AZ morphology, while genetic constraints on AZ identity determination in these two lineages.\n\nSignificance statementExploring the extent of genetic convergence that underlies the morphological convergence - specifically, the recurrent evolution of complete abscission zones in independently evolved weedy rice populations originating from different cultivated rice populations with varying degrees of disrupted abscission zones - can improve our understanding not only of the genetic mechanisms behind convergent evolution, but also of the genetics underlying the agriculturally importance trait of seed shattering.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.28.615607", "title": "Identifying Agronomic, Nutrition and Leaf Vein Quantitative Trait Loci in the Orphan Crop Gynandropsis gynandra", "authors": "Simpson, C.

However, real plants operate as integrated wholes, with feedbacks between sources and sinks resulting in homeostatic concentrations of metabolites such as sugars. An approach to implementing such behaviour in a plant growth model is presented and its implications for responses to generic environmental factors assessed. The approach is based on Hill functions representing inhibition of C sources (net photosynthesis) and activation of sinks (structural growth) based on sugar concentrations. The model is parameterised for a mature tropical rainforest site and its qualitative behaviour is found to be consistent with experimental observations. Key findings are that sinks and sources strongly regulate each other. For example, doubling potential net photosynthesis (i.e. the rate that would occur without feedback) results in growth increasing by only 1/3 at equilibrium, with increased sugar concentration causing feedback-inhibition of photosynthesis. A source-only driven response, as in current global models, would result in close to a doubling of growth. Hence environmental factors that affect potential net photosynthesis, such as atmospheric CO2, have greatly reduced effects on growth when homeostatic behaviour of sugars is considered.

Additionally, mice failed to clear pulmonary infections caused by Persistent isolates but not Eradicated isolates despite comparable responses in leukocyte recruitment and cytokine responses. We demonstrate that loss of Type IV pilus-mediated twitching motility confers a fitness advantage for a Persistent isolate during a murine pulmonary infection, and restoration of pilus-mediated twitching motility improves in vivo bacterial clearance.

Through conjugation, plasmid-encoded AMR genes are spread among neighbouring bacteria, irrespective of their strain or even their species. This process is very concerning from a public health perspective, as plasmid-borne AMR gene outbreaks are often not confined to single species or strains and are therefore more difficult to be fully uncovered. At the moment, the impact of plasmid conjugation on within-patient plasmid diversity is not well understood. In this work we will tackle the role of conjugation on within-patient plasmid diversity using a dataset of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPEs). The dataset of 256 sequences from 115 patients was sampled across England over 30 months. Each patient has more than one sequence, with at least one sequence carrying an OXA-48 gene, a well-known plasmid-borne carbapenemase-encoding gene. If more than one sequence carries the OXA-48 gene, they are carried on different bacterial hosts. Using a hybrid de novo-on-reference assembly pipeline, we were able to reconstruct the full OXA-48 plasmid from short read sequencing data for 232 of the 256 sequences. Of the 115 patients, 83 (72%) of patients had an identical OXA-48 plasmid in two or more sequences. Only 2 patients carried very different (>200 SNPs) alleles of the OXA-48 plasmid, probably from separate acquisitions. Our study shows that when more than one bacterial host carrying an OXA-48 plasmid is found in a patient, it is most likely that the same plasmid has been shared via conjugation. The event of separate acquisition of different plasmids in different bacterial hosts is highly unlikely in our dataset.\n\nData StatementWe use data provided by Hopkins et al 2022 [16]. The data can be accessed from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and can be found at Bioproject Accession no. PRJNA788733. None of the data used was synthetically generated.\n\nImpact StatementConjugative plasmids are well known vessels of horizontal gene transfer, with a prominent role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes among different bacterial species or strains. At the epidemiological level, conjugation combined with sequencing a single colony per patient, results in plasmids outbreaks carrying antimicrobial resistance genes being found in different bacterial species and strains in different patients, potentially eluding surveillance protocols based on same bacterium/same resistance scheme. In this study we analyse within-patient plasmid diversity in a dataset with more than one sequence per patient. Only two patients show clear genomic signs of separate plasmids acquisition, while 83 patients share identical plasmids in different bacterial hosts.

However, when cells move through the complex 3D environment of living tissues, they have to squeeze their nucleus that is stiffer than the rest of the cell. The lamin network, organised as a shell right underneath the nuclear membrane, contributes to the nuclear integrity and stiffness. Yet, its response during squeezed cell motility has never been fully characterised. As a result, up to now, the interpretations on the lamin response mechanism are mainly speculative. Here, we quantitatively map the lamin A/C distribution in both a microfluidic migration device and a microfluidic aspiration device. In the first case, the cell is actively involved in translocating the nucleus through the constriction, while in the second case, the cell behaves as a passive object that is pushed through the constriction by an external pressure. Using a quantitative description of the lamin shell response based on mass conservation arguments applied on the fluorescence signal of lamin, we show that in both cases of migration and aspiration, the response of the lamin network is passive. In this way, our results not only further elucidate the lamin response mechanism, but also allow to distinguish this passive deformation response from other active responses that may occur when the nucleus is squeezed through constrictions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615313", "title": "Pexidartinib plus FLT3-directed CAR-Macrophage for the treatment of FLT3-ITD-mutated acute myeloid leukemia in preclinical model", "authors": "Chen, F.; Lv, M.-H.; Li, C.-W.; Zhang, Y.-Q.; Wei, Z.-X.; Yuan, Z.; Cao, J.-Y.; Yang, X.; Xu, J.-B.; Wang, L.; He, B.-L.", "author_corresponding": "Bai-Liang He", "author_corresponding_institution": "The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University", "date": "2024-09-29", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "cancer biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/29/2024.09.27.615313.source.xml", "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) mutations occur in about 25%-30% of AML cases and are associated with adverse prognosis. Recent advances indicate that M2-like leukemia-associated macrophages (M2-LAM) are highly infiltrated in the bone marrow of FLT3-ITD+ AML patients; however, the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications are still elusive. Herein, we reveal that conditioned medium from FLT3-ITD+ MOLM-13 AML cells polarized M2-LAM and impaired their phagocytic activities. Unexpectedly, co-culture of M2-LAM protected MOLM-13 cells from the treatment of FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib by activating their FLT3 signaling pathway. Pharmaceutically, FLT3/CSF1R dual inhibitor pexidartinb effectively suppressed M2-LAM, reduced leukemic burden, and prolonged the survival of MOLM-13-xenografted mice. To enhance the phagocytic activities of macrophages, FLT3-directed chimeric antigen receptor-engineered macrophages (FLT3L-CAR-Macrophage) were generated using FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) as the recognizing domain of CAR. Transfection of THP-1 monocytic cells-or umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells-derived macrophages with FLT3L-CAR-encoding mRNA enhanced their phagocytic activities to MOLM-13 cells in vitro. Consistently, FLT3L-CAR-Macrophage differentiated from FLT3L-CAR-expressing THP-1 cells effectively phagocytosed MOLM-13 cells in vitro, reduced leukemic burden and prolonged the survival of MOLM-13-xenografted mice. Importantly, treatment of pexidartinib resulted in upregulation and surface localization of FLT3-ITD protein in MOLM-13 cells, sensitized MOLM-13 cells to the treatment of FLT3L-CAR-Macrophage in vitro, and synergized with FLT3L-CAR-Macrophage to further reduce leukemic burden in MOLM-13-xenografted mice. Together, our data indicate that pexidartinib plus FLT3L-CAR-Macrophage could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of FLT3-ITD+ AML in preclinical model which warrants further investigation.\n\nGraphical AbstractPexidartinib plus FLT3L-CAR-M{varphi} for the treatment of FLT3-ITD+ AML in preclinical model.

To explain this, both physiological and computational studies have suggested the use of movement primitives or the existence of an internal body representation, much like they are assumed to occur in vertebrates. Since insects lack a dedicated posture-sensing organ or vestibular system, it is hypothesized that they derive high-level postural information from low-level proprioceptive cues, integrated across their limbs. The present study tests the extent to which a multi-layer spiking neural network can extract high-level information about limb movement and whole-body posture from information provided by distributed local proprioceptors. In a preceding part of the study, we introduced the phasic-tonic encoding of joint angles by strictly local proprioceptive hair field afferents, as well as high-accuracy encoding of joint angles and angular velocities in first-order interneurons. Here, we extend this model by second-order interneurons that use coincidence detection from two or three leg-local inputs to encode movement primitives of a single leg. Using experimental data on whole-body kinematics of unrestrained walking and climbing stick insects, we show that these movement primitives can be used to signal particular step cycle phases, but also step cycle transitions such as leg lift-off. Additionally, third-order interneurons are introduced to indicate climbing behaviour, for example by encoding the body pitch angle from 6 x 3 local leg joints. All encoding properties are validated against annotated experimental data, allowing for relevance rating of particular leg types and/or leg joint actions for all measures encoded. Our results demonstrate that simple combinations of two or three position/velocity inputs from disjunct hair field arrays are sufficient to encode high-order movement information about step cycle phases. The resulting movement primitive encoding may converge to represent particular locomotor states and whole-body posture.\n\nAuthor summaryInsect behaviours such as navigation or climbing involve complex movement sequences that have led scientists to postulate the existence of an internal body representation. As insects lack a dedicated organ for monitoring body posture, a major problem in computational neuroscience and biomimetic robotics is how high-level information about body posture and coordinated movement may be extracted from distributed, local, low-level sensory measures, such as joint angles or angular velocities. To solve this problem, we developed a spiking neural network model. The model was tuned and evaluated with experimental data on complex climbing sequences of stick insects, with detailed information about 6 x 3 joint angle time courses. In a preceding study, we focused on how joint angle sensors encode this information at various body parts and how it is processed to represent local joint position and movement. Here, we extend the model to include neurons that signal particular phases of a legs movement cycle. Other neurons encode whole-body movement, using the body pitch angle as an example parameter. We show that a straight-forward combination of movement signals from various body parts can indicate the timing of particular step cycle events, as well as provide an internal representation of the full bodys posture.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615327", "title": "FASER: A TOOL TO SIMULATE PSF DISTORTIONS IN STEDMICROSCOPY", "authors": "Bancelin, S.; Nagerl, V.; Roos, J.", "author_corresponding": "Valentin Nagerl", "author_corresponding_institution": "Universite de Bordeaux", "date": "2024-09-29", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/29/2024.09.27.615327.source.xml", "abstract": "We introduce Faser, a software package developed in Python as a plugin for the open-source napari platform, designed to simulate the excitation point spread functions (PSFs) of microscopes.

Here, we employ a miniature microscope imaging approach to monitor the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction at the single cell level. We find that amygdala interneurons display mixed-selectivity and show complex plastic responses at both the ensemble and single neuron level across the acquisition, expression and extinction of aversive memories. In contrast to bidirectional single cell plasticity across distinct fear states, learning-induced changes at the population level occur transiently during conditioning and do not consolidate across days. Examining molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that disinhibitory vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells are predominantly activated by high fear states. In contrast, somatostatin (SST) interneurons display a preference for safety cues and thereby suppress excitatory neuron responsiveness. However, responses of individual neurons within the SST and VIP populations are non-uniform, indicating the presence of functional subtypes within classical molecularly-defined interneuron populations.

Still, given the range of segment numbers observed in different anthozoans, it remains unclear whether this Hox-Gbx module is evolutionarily conserved and how it might be deployed to generate different numbers of segments.

We first characterize the temporal sequence of segmentation in M. capitata juveniles and then combine transcriptomic profiling and in situ hybridization to identify three conserved homeobox-containing genes, McAnthox8, McAnthox6a.1 and McGbx, which are collectively expressed in the developing endo-mesoderm prior to and during segment formation. The expression boundaries of these genes prefigure the positions of the first six segment boundaries, similar to their Nematostella homologs.

Our spatially-resolved transcriptomics (ST) data point to unique perturbations in brain energy metabolism during the progression of aSyn pathology, such that the early stage of aSyn aggregate pathology activates molecular pathways controlling metabolic flux through glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. In contrast, the ST data indicate a profound decline in mitochondrial metabolism in the brains of symptomatic animals with advanced aSyn pathology. The latter stage was also associated with drastic reduction in mRNA translation machinery, along with aberrant expression of molecular drivers involved in RNA splicing and inflammatory response. Intriguingly, our ST data also point to perturbed regulation of circadian rhythm, was corroborated by increased immunodetection of CREB-binding protein (a modulator of core clock machinery) in the brains of symptomatic animals, and transcriptional upregulation of CREBBP in 4 independent PD microarray datasets.

We hypothesized that a tRNA-cleaving toxin similar to zymocin may have caused the three parallel changes to the nuclear genetic code that occurred during yeast evolution, in which the codon CUG became translated as Ser or Ala instead of Leu. However, zymocin-like toxins are rare - both among species, and among strains within a species - and only four toxins of this type have previously been discovered. Here, we identified 45 new zymocin-like toxin genes in Saccharomycotina, the budding yeast subphylum, using a novel bioinformatics strategy, and verified that many of them are toxic to S. cerevisiae when expressed. Some of the new toxin genes are located on cytosolic VLEs, whereas others are on VLE-derived DNA integrated into the nuclear genome. The toxins are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and show evidence of positive selection.

Here, we performed a genome-wide screen on fetal murine cardiomyocytes to identify potential novel regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation.

C5aR1 was traditionally thought to be primarily expressed on the cell membrane, although recent reports indicate the importance of intracellular C5aR1 expression for the inflammatory effector functions of various cell types. However, the mechanisms regulating C5aR1 expression and localisation remain unclear. In tumours with an immunosuppressive microenvironment, we recently found robust C5aR1 expression on malignant epithelial cells, highlighting potential tumour cell-specific functions. Here, we show that hypoxia, a hallmark of immunosuppressive microenvironments, induces C5aR1 expression in an unfolded protein response (UPR)-dependent manner via enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, hypoxia drives endocytosis, relocating C5aR1 from the cell membrane to the intracellular compartment. By genetically and pharmacologically targeting the C5a/C5aR1 axis, we show that C5aR1 mediates cellular adaptation to hypoxia by regulating processes associated with cell fate, including autophagy and apoptosis. In line with hypoxia-induced intracellular C5aR1 pools, pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1, particularly with cell-permeable small molecule inhibitors, significantly reduces tumour cell survival. These results suggest that the dysregulated C5a/C5aR1 axis and the hypoxia-induced shift in C5aR1 localisation, support tumour cell survival and provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for targeting the C5a/C5aR1 axis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615385", "title": "Novel preclinical model of human lung cancer cachexia", "authors": "Snoke, D.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with a large percentage of patients experiencing CC. Despite a wealth of mechanistic data on CC, there are no approved treatments, which may relate to the fact that many pre-clinical models do not reproduce the pathophysiological features of human CC.\n\nMethodsWe generated tamoxifen-inducible, club cell specific KrasG12D/+ (G12D) mice to model lung cancer and investigated the development and progression of CC by assessing tumor characteristics, time course of CC, adipose and skeletal muscle tissue sizes and transcriptional profiles, and circulating inflammatory cytokines.\n\nResultsInduction of the KrasG12D allele caused adenocarcinomas in the terminal bronchioles, which were evident at initiation of weight loss (10.5 {+/-} 1.1% lung volume at 6 weeks). Weight loss in G12D mice averaged 15% over 12 weeks, with loss of both adipose (-72%-85% vs. WT) and skeletal muscle tissue mass (-17-23% vs. WT) and tissue transcriptional profiles consistent with CC. Exploiting the protracted time course of this model, we found that early during CC adipose tissue, but not skeletal muscle, mass and cell size were reduced by greater than 50% in G12D mice compared to WT, a result that was confirmed in a more rapidly progressive, Kras driven model of lung CC containing Stk11 loss of function (KrasG12D/+/Stk11-/-) where depletion of adipose depots (>50% vs WT) occurred over 3.5 weeks. G12D mice showed circulating metabolomic markers of increased fat mobilization/utilization, including elevated glycerol levels (+20% vs. WT), which was also apparent in patients with lung cancer (+79% vs. non-cancer controls). Additionally, 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with conditioned media (CM) from tumor organoids developed from G12D mice caused a 3-fold increase in glycerol and 2-3 fold increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine release compared to CM from WT lung tissue.\n\nConclusionsG12D mice develop CC over a more protracted period and phenocopy tumor and tissue cellular, mutational, transcriptomic, and metabolic characteristics relevant to human lung CC. Additionally, G12D mice show early loss of adipose tissue, and factors released from G12D lung tumor organoids produce metabolic adaptations in vitro that promote adipose tissue wasting.

Yet, as opposed to extensive research on glial-vascular interactions in rodents, such interactions remain largely overlooked in the zebrafish model system. Here, we focus on glial-vascular development in the zebrafish brain, leveraging three glial gene promoters: gfap (glial fibrillary acidic protein), glast (an astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter), and glastini (a new, shortened, equally effective version of the Glast promoter). Using these glial promoters, sparse labeling revealed fewer glial-vascular interactions during early larval stages, with both glial coverage and contact area increasing as the zebrafish brain matured. We then generated stable transgenic lines for both the Glast and Glastini promoters and observed similar increases in glial coverage during larval development, starting at [~]30% coverage at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and peaking at [~]60% at 10 dpf. Ultrastructural assessment of glial-vascular interactions using electron microscopy (EM) confirmed a progressive increase in glial coverage over larval development, with maximal coverage reaching [~]70% in adult zebrafish, significantly lower than the nearly 100% coverage observed in mammals.

Next, we used these data to test hypotheses from life history theory about allocation and acquisition of resources based on associations of nestling size and growth with glucose physiology and assessed whether these relationships are modified by parental care. We found that larger nestlings had higher baseline blood glucose and larger magnitude of change in glucose in response to a stressor. Further, this relationship was most pronounced among birds in nests that received the lowest amount of parental care. Given that glucose metabolism fuels activity and is critical in the vertebrate stress response, these results suggest that physiological constraints may contribute to the early-life disadvantage of being smaller, especially in the context of lower parental care.

Companion studies across seven meaning domains demonstrated systematic relationships, varying by domain, between the perceptual ratings, phonetic features, and acoustic parameters of a set of 537 pseudowords (Lacey et al. 2024a, 2024b). Here we employed a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) machine-learning algorithm to compare 4094 combinations of twelve acoustic parameters (3 spectro-temporal and 9 characterizing vocal quality) and identify the parameter combination that best predicted perceptual ratings in each domain. Using multiple regression, we then examined the relative contributions of the parameters comprising the best performing acoustic model for each domain. Finally, we used the KNN approach to generate sound-symbolic ratings, in the shape domain, for 160 real words and compared these predicted ratings with corresponding perceptual ratings. We found that sound-symbolic mappings rely on domain-specific combinations and weights of acoustic parameters.

Key to understanding the state of neuroscience research is an assessment of reporting practices that influence replicability, reliability, and generalizability. In this structured review, we evaluated reporting practice across three domains: (1) demographic (e.g., reporting participant race-ethnicity, age, any measure of socioeconomic position), (2) methodological (e.g., reporting recruitment methods, inclusion and exclusion criteria, why participants were excluded from analyses), and (3) open science and generalizability (e.g., analyses were preregistered, target population was stated). Included were 919 published MRI and fMRI studies from 2019 in nine top-ranked journals (N = 3,856 records screened). Reporting across domains was infrequent, with participant racial or ethnic identity (14.8%), reasons for missing imaging data (31.2%), and identification of a target population (19.4%) being particularly low/underreported. Reporting likelihood varied by study characteristics (e.g., participant age group) and was correlated across domains. The median sample size of studies was 55 participants.

To explore the autoimmune-related miRNA expression profile in pediatric patients with idiopathic uveitis (IU) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-AU) and find a common molecular background for idiopathic uveitis and other autoimmune diseases.\n\nMaterials and methodsThe expression levels of miRNAs were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using serum samples from patients with idiopathic uveitis (n=8), juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (n=7), and healthy controls. We selected the most promising miRNAs from the original research papers: miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-451a as markers for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, miR-23a-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-140-5p, miR-193a-5p and miR-491-5p for uveitis in the adult population, and miR-125a-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-223-5p, miR-223-3p characteristic for both diseases and confirm their expression changes in serum from children with idiopathic uveitis.

Neovascularization and nodular mesangial sclerosis are manifestations of dysregulated communication in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We sought to understand the spatially-anchored regulation and transition of endothelial and mesangial cells from health to injury in DKD.\n\nMethodsFrom 77 human kidney biopsy samples, an integrated multi-omics approach was leveraged to identify cellular niches, cell-cell communication, cell injury trajectories, and regulatory transcription factor (TF) networks in glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells. Data were culled from single nucleus RNA sequencing, single nucleus ATAC sequencing, and three orthogonal spatial transcriptomic technologies and correlated with histopathological and clinical trial data.\n\nResultsWe identified a cellular niche of the diabetic glomerulus enriched in a proliferative endothelial cell sub type (prEC) and altered vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Cellular communication within this niche maintained pro-angiogenic signaling with loss of anti-angiogenic factors. We identified a TF network of MEF2C, MEF2A, and TRPS1 which regulated SEMA6A and PLXNA2, a receptor-ligand pair opposing angiogenesis. In silico knockout of the TF network disrupted the transition from a healthy glomerular capillary endothelial cell (EC-GC) to a prEC, with concomitant acceleration toward a degenerative (injury) endothelial phenotype. Glomeruli enriched in the prEC niche had histologic evidence of neovascularization. A pro-fibrotic niche mapped in segmentally sclerotic DKD glomeruli. MEF2C activity was increased in diabetic glomeruli and more so in glomeruli with nodular mesangial sclerosis. The gene regulatory network (GRN) of MEF2C was dysregulated in EC-GCs of patients with DKD, but sodium glucose trasporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) treatment reversed the MEF2C GRN effects of DKD.\n\nConclusionsThe MEF2C, MEF2A, and TRPS1 TF network carefully balances the fate of the EC-GC in DKD. When the TF network is \"on\" or over-expressed in DKD, EC-GCs may progress to a prEC state, while TF suppression leads to cell death. prEC abundance and signaling underlie neovascularization in DKD.

To extend while challenging existing knowledge, this study applies real time brightfield and confocal imaging to inseminated ZP-intact mouse oocytes and statistical analyses to establish an accurate dynamic picture of the cascade of events leading to fusion and prevention of polyspermy in conditions as close to physiology as possible. These observations allow to characterize the roles of the different components of the oocyte (i.e. zona pellucida (ZP), perivitelline space (PVS), oocyte plasma membrane (OPM)) and the spermatozoon (i.e. head, flagellum) in promoting fertilization and preventing polyspermy. The kinetics we have determined challenge dogmas by showing that: (i) the first sperm is not necessarily the one that fertilizes in mice pointing to the existence of other post-penetration fertilization factors, (ii) the ZP block resulting from the cortical reaction is too slow to contribute to the prevention of polyspermy in mice. On the other hand, it evidences that the ZP directly contributes to polyspermy block in two other ways: (a) as a naturally effective entry barrier for the spermatozoon (independent of any block caused by fertilization), (b) as an effective exit barrier for components released by the OPM, which may contribute to a fast PVS block to polyspermy through the neutralizing of unwanted spermatozoa in the PVS.

However, TMED9s mechanism of action is not well understood. Here we show that TMED9 plays a central role in the PQC of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) and provide mechanistic insight. Typically, misfolded GPI-APs dissociate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone calnexin and move to the Golgi by the Rapid ER stress-induced Export (RESET) pathway, and are subsequently trafficked to lysosomes via the plasma membrane. We used biochemical and imaging approaches in cultured cells to demonstrate that misfolded GPI-APs dissociate from calnexin and associate with TMED9 during RESET. Depletion of TMED9 with siRNA or its chemical inhibitor, BRD4780, blocked ER-export of misfolded GPI-APs. By contrast, TMED9-depletion did not prevent ER-export of wild type GPI-APs for secretion, indicating a specific role for TMED9 in GPI-AP PQC. Intriguingly, we discovered that acute treatment with BRD4780 induced a shift in TMED9 localization from the ER to the downstream Golgi cisternae and a block to the RESET pathway. Removal of BRD4780 following acute treatment returned TMED9 to the ER where TMED9 was able to associate with the RESET substrate and restore the RESET pathway. Based on these data, we propose a model in which TMED9 participates in RESET by capturing misfolded GPI-APs that are released by calnexin within the ER and conveying them to the Golgi.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615512", "title": "The Human Neural Cell Atlas of Zika Infection in developing human brain tissue: viralpathogenesis, innate immunity, and lineage reprogramming", "authors": "Stokes, C.; Whitmore, L.; Moreno, D.; Malhotra, K.; Tisoncik-Go, J.; Tran, E.; Wren, N.; Glass, I.; Birth Defects Research Laboratory,  ; Young, J.

This is especially important for accurate tissue modeling as researchers continue to incorporate the endothelium into engineered tissues.\n\nMethodsWe illustrated the heterogeneity of cells produced from different differentiation protocols by focusing on two selected protocols, one driving differentiation exclusively using small molecules (SM Protocol) and one driving differentiation primarily using growth factors (GF Protocol). We characterized the cells through a combination of vasculogenic computational analysis following encapsulation in 3D hydrogels, RNA sequencing, and measurement of soluble factor release.\n\nResultsVasculogenic computational analysis indicates that cells from the GF protocol formed more dense and interconnected vasculature compared to cells from the SM protocol. Likewise, RNA-seq analysis showed GF-derived cell enrichment in pathways involved in cell migration and angiogenesis. In addition, GF-derived cells favor differentiation to arterial endothelial cells as well as predisposition to undergoing a partial endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, whereas SM-derived cells resemble immature progenitors based on higher proliferation rates as well as ECM remodeling. These trends also persisted following extended 3D culture.\n\nConclusionsThe results demonstrate that despite using the same starting hiPSC population and isolating EPs using the same surface marker, the two differentiation protocols yield highly distinct cell populations. This work highlights the importance of understanding the specific endothelial subtypes produced by different differentiation protocols for the creation of more accurate tissue models.\n\nLay SummaryAlthough multiple groups have created protocols for differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to endothelial progenitors (EPs), it is not clear if different differentiation protocols generate different endothelial subtypes, matching the variance seen in vivo To that end, we performed an in-depth characterization of two selected hiPSC-EP differentiation protocols, primarily focusing on cells cultured in 3D hydrogels, to better understand the specific endothelial subtypes produced. We found significant differences in both cell maturity and cell phenotype that persisted even after extended culture.\n\nFuture WorkFuture work will involve extending the existing study to include additional hiPSC-EP differentiation protocols as well as conducting single-cell RNAseq to better understand the makeup of different cell populations both before and after isolating CD34+ cells. Because smooth muscle cells play an important role in vessel stabilization, we will also incorporate hiPSC-derived smooth muscle cells into the system.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615390", "title": "Sedentary lifestyle induces oxidative stress and atrophy in rat skeletal muscle", "authors": "Gungor, I.; Akin, S.; Powers, S.

Therefore, maintaining healthy skeletal muscles is essential to good health. While it is established that prolonged skeletal muscle inactivity results in both oxidative stress and muscle atrophy, it remains unknown if the change from an active to a sedentary lifestyle promotes a similar increase in oxidative stress and locomotor muscle atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the transition from active to sedentary living results in the rapid development of oxidative damage and fiber atrophy in locomotor skeletal muscles. Adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into control (CON; n=8) and sedentary (SED; n=8) groups. During a seven-day experimental period, animals in the CON group were housed in standard size cages permitting free movement, while animals in the SED group were housed in small cages that promoted sedentary behavior. At the end of the experimental protocol, soleus muscles were removed and the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined along with two biomarkers of muscle oxidative stress (i.e., levels of advanced protein oxidation (AOPP) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)). Living in the reduced-size cage resulted in muscle atrophy as evidenced by a 17.2% decrease in the soleus to body weight ratio (P<0.001). Moreover, the activities of SOD, CAT and GPX in the soleus muscle were significantly decreased in SED animals compared to CON (P<0.05). Finally, compared to CON, sedentary living increased both AOPP and 4-HNE levels in muscles of SED animals (P<0.001 and P <0.05, respectively). These findings provide the first evidence that the transition from an active to sedentary lifestyle results in the rapid onset of oxidative stress and atrophy in locomotor skeletal muscles.

Promising results from recent clinical studies have generated a wave of interest in employing psilocybin to treat neuropsychiatric and neuro-degenerative conditions. How psychedelics cause acute perceptual effects, and how these relate to long-lasting alterations is still debated. Whereas it is thought that perceptual disturbances may be caused by disrupted flow of information between sensory and higher order areas, in vivo studies have focused mostly on the latter. In particular, there has been little study of how psilocybin affects sensory representations in primary auditory cortex (A1). We used two-photon microscopy and wide field calcium imaging to examine how psilocybin affects A1 neuron response properties in the mouse. Administration of 1 mg/kg psilocybin prevented habituation of sound-evoked responses to repeated stimuli, maintaining overall responsiveness, bandwidth, and sound-level response thresholds after repeated stimulation. This was in contrast to marked habituation of responses and narrowing of tuning in controls. We observed no effect on overall distribution of best frequencies at the cortical level, suggesting psilocybin in A1 disrupts normal sensory gating, rather than tonotopic organization. This supports models of psychedelic action in which perceptual disturbances are driven by disrupted hierarchical sensory gating. With further research, influences of psychedelics on sensory representations could be harnessed to target maladaptive sensory processing in conditions such as tinnitus.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite its role in altering auditory sensory perception, the impact of psilocybin on modulating neuronal activity in the auditory cortex remains understudied. This study is the first to identify an inhibition of normal auditory habituation to repeated stimuli with single-neuron resolution. We identify a role for psilocybin in the targeted, context-dependent modulation of auditory sensory neural tuning properties, which may help to explain how disruption of hierarchical control of sensory representations leads to perceptual disturbances. With further work, this influence on sensory representations could be used to target conditions where maladaptive sensory processing leads to deleterious health outcomes.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615359", "title": "Targeting Neuropilin-1 to Enhance Immunotherapy in Melanoma: Reducing Tumour Progression and Peripheral Treg-Mediated Immunosuppression", "authors": "Khamaru, S.; Tung, K.

These ecosystems are threatened by various human-induced stressors, which frequently co-occur and may interact in complex ways, potentially triggering cascading effects in the river network. Aiming at assessing single and combined effects of flow intermittency and light pollution on macroinvertebrate communities, we performed a multiple stressors experiment in 18 flow-through mesocosms. Each mesocosm was designed to mimic a simplified river network, with two upstream tributaries merging downstream, to assess both local and cascading effects. The experiment was performed in Summer 2021 for seven weeks (26 days of colonization, 23 days of treatment), applying the stressors either separately or combined in the upstream sections, in a randomized block design. Flow intermittency was simulated as the ponded phase of the drying process, whereas light pollution was applied with LED strips (set at 10 lux) that automatically turned on at sunset and off at sunrise. Drifting macroinvertebrates were sampled weekly during the treatment phase, and benthic macroinvertebrates at the end of the treatment phase. Both stressors individually applied had negative effects on the benthos, whereas drift decreased with flow intermittency and increased with light pollution. When combined upstream, stressors showed dominant effects of flow intermittency on the benthos and interactive effects on the drift. The effects of the single stressors and their interactions propagated along the river network, with stronger downstream effects when stressors co-occurred upstream. These findings showed that the spatial distribution of multiple stressors along the river network can affect their resultant downstream effects, highlighting the importance of framing multiple stressors research in a spatial context.

Although these efforts have shown varying levels of success, all approaches have shown there is a strong correlation between phenotype (of both fungal mycelia and mycelial materials assembly) and resultant mechanical properties. We hypothesize that genetic means can be used to generate specific fungal phenotypes, leading to mycelial materials with specific mechanical properties. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used a mutant of the model filamentous fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, with a deletion of the last kinase in the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway, mpkA. We generated one set of mycelial materials from the {Delta}mpkA deletion mutant (A1404), and another from its isogenic parent (A1405; control). When subjected to tensile testing, and compared to material generated from the control, {Delta}mpkA material has similar elastic modulus, but significantly increased ultimate tensile strength, and strain at failure. When subjected to a fragmentation assay (i.e., resistance to shear-stress), the {Delta}mpkA material also had higher relative mechanical strength. To determine possible causes for this behavior, we carried out a comprehensive set of phenotype assessments focused on: three-dimensional structure, hyphal morphology, hyphal growth behaviors, and conidial development.

To address the latter, Zhang and Mirarab (2022) leverage gene tree branch lengths and support values to weight quartets within the popular summary method ASTRAL. Although these quartet weighting schemes improved the robustness of ASTRAL to gene tree estimation error, implementing the weighting schemes presented computational challenges, resulting in the authors abandoning ASTRALs original search algorithm (i.e., computing an exact solution within a constrained search space) in favor of search heuristics (i.e., hill climbing with nearest neighbor interchange moves from a starting tree constructed via randomized taxon addition). Here, we show that these quartet weighting schemes can be leveraged within the Quartet Max Cut framework of Snir and Rao (2010), with only a small increase in time complexity compared to the unweighted algorithm, which behaves more like a constant factor in our simulation study. Moreover, our new algorithm, implemented within the TREE-QMC software, was highly competitive with weighted ASTRAL, even outperforming it in terms of species tree accuracy on some challenging model conditions, such as large numbers of taxa. In comparing unweighted and weighted summary methods on two avian data sets, we found that weighting quartets by gene tree branch lengths improves their robustness to systematic homology errors and is as effective as removing the impacted taxa from individual gene trees or removing the impacted gene trees entirely.

The functional reconstitution of transmembrane in liposomes can be challenging, especially, if the hydrophobic thickness of the protein does not match the thickness of the surrounding lipid bilayer. During the reconstitution procedure Such hydrophobic mismatch causes low yields and protein aggregation, which are exacerbated in sterol-rich membranes featuring low membrane compressibility. Here, we explore new approaches to reversibly tune membrane sterol contents proteoliposomes after their formation. Both cholesterol delivery and extraction are mediated by methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin in a dialysis setting, which maintains (proteo)liposomes in a confined compartment. This makes it possible to reversibly tune the cholesterol level without losing membrane material simply by placing the dialysis cassette in a new bath containing either empty or cholesterol-loaded methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin. Cholesterol delivery and removal is monitored with the solvatochromic probe C-Laurdan, which reports on lipid packing. Using Forster-resonance energy transfer, we show that cholesterol delivery to proteoliposomes induces the oligomerization of a membrane property sensor, while the subsequent removal of cholesterol demonstrates the full reversibility. We propose that tuning membrane compressibility by methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin-meditated cholesterol delivery and removal in a dialysis setup provides a new handle to study its impact on membrane protein structure, function, and dynamics.\n\nStatement of significanceGenerating complex, sterol-rich, biomimetic membranes for studying the structure and function of reconstituted membrane proteins is challenging.

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by C-Laurdan and dehydroergosterol fluorescence spectroscopy and gain control over the membrane sterol content.

Analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrate that only the second of the three LC8 recognition motifs is necessary for a stable bridged complex. The stability of the bridged complex is tuned by multivalency, binding specificity of the second LC8 site, and the length of the linker separating the LC8 binding domain and OD. 53BP1 mutants deficient in bridged species fail to impact 53BP1 focus formation in human cell culture studies, suggesting that the primary role of LC8 is to bridge 53BP1 trimers which in turn promotes recruitment of 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage.

However, in vivo environments are geometrically, mechanically, and chemically complex, and it has been difficult to understand how each of these parameters contribute to the propulsive strategy utilized by cells in these diverse settings. To address this, we employed a sacrificial micromolding approach to generate polymer substrates with tunable stiffness, controlled adhesivity, and user-defined microscale geometries. We combined this together with live-cell imaging and three-dimensional traction force microscopy (TFM) to quantify the forces that cells use to transit through constricting channels. Surprisingly, we observe that cells migrating through compliant constrictions take longer to transit and experience greater nuclear deformation than those migrating through more rigid constrictions. TFM reveals that this deformation is generated by inwardly directed contractile forces that decrease the size of the opening and pull the walls closed around the nucleus. These findings show that nuclear deformation during confined migration can be accomplished by internal cytoskeletal machinery rather than by reactive forces from the substrate, and our approach provides a mechanism to test between different models for how cells translocate their nucleus through narrow constrictions. The methods, analysis, and results presented here will be useful to understand how cells choose between propulsive strategies in different physical environments.\n\nSignificance StatementCell migration is critical for both physiological events like wound healing and pathological events like metastasis. Understanding how cells move through complex environments will assist efforts to enhance or inhibit such processes. We developed a method to quantify the forces that cells use to move through multidimensional environments, including through narrow constrictions like those in tissues. Surprisingly, we find that cells transiting through soft constrictions take longer and deform more than those transiting through rigid constrictions, and we connect this finding to inwardly directed contractile forces generated by migrating cells.

Here, using super-resolution imaging technique, we explored an organelle-level understanding of the effect of anaesthesia on plant roots and the stem connecting to the root. Our results showed that the nuclei organized themselves in an orchestrated manner upon treatment with both local and general anaesthesia without damaging their structure.

Habits are reflexive, inflexible, and fast, in contrast to goal-directed behaviour which is reflective, flexible, and slow. Current theories assume that habits and goal-directed actions are controlled by two separate but interacting systems. However, it is not clear how these two systems interact when actions must be made under time pressure. Here we use a task which induces habitual behaviour in the form of action sequences, while concurrently requiring participants to perform goal-directed actions that are either congruent or incongruent with the habit. This task thus allows for concurrent measurement of both goal-directed and habitual behaviour, thereby permitting a nuanced analysis of the interaction between these two control modes. Using computational modelling, we find that models where the influence of the habit depends on the number of repetitions, explain participant behaviour better than models that assume the habit to be constant. We further show that roughly half of the participants modulate their use of the habit depending on the context, i.e. they selectively inhibit the habits influence when it is incongruent to their explicit goals, but not when both are congruent and the influence of the habit is adaptive. Additional drift-diffusion modelling of choice and reaction time data shows that proactive control is mobilized in the congruent task context whereas reactive control is mobilized in the incongruent task context. The present study thus indicates that habitual control is context-dependent and can be adaptively deployed via proactive and reactive control, rather than being a fixed or isolated mechanism.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615545", "title": "Non-invasive brain stimulation over the Frontopolar Cortex promotes willingness to exert cognitive effort in a foraging-like sequential choice task", "authors": "Bogdanov, M.; Bustamante, L.

Recent work employing tasks that provide explicit information about demands and incentives, suggests causal involvement of the Frontopolar Cortex (FPC) in effort-based decision-making. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we examined whether the FPCs role in motivating effort generalizes to sequential choice problems in which task demand and reward rates vary indirectly and as a function of experience. In a double-blind, within- subject design, 46 participants received anodal (i.e., excitatory) or sham stimulation over the right FPC during an Effort Foraging Task, which required choosing between harvesting patches for successively decreasing resources or traveling to replenished patches by performing a cognitive task with environment-specific difficulty. As expected, participants exited patches later (i.e., displayed lower exit thresholds) when travelling required greater (versus less) effort, indicating increased travel costs in high-effort environments. Under anodal tDCS, the difference in exit thresholds between environments was significantly smaller relative to sham. Finally, individual differences analyses hint that participants with lower self-reported motivation to exert effort exhibited greater travel cost reductions following tDCS. Together, these findings support the theorized causal role of the FPC in motivating cognitively effortful behavior, expand its role to more ecologically valid serial decisions and highlight the potential for tDCS as a tool to increase motivation with potential clinical applications.\n\nSignificance statementUncovering the neural mechanisms regulating engagement in effortful behavior is crucial, as it will improve our understanding and treatment of conditions characterized by reduced motivation, e.g., apathy and anhedonia. The Frontopolar Cortex (FPC) has been implicated in increasing effort exertion in settings that provide explicit information about effort demand and reward. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we investigated whether the FPC retains its motivating capacity in sequential choice problems that vary effort and reward indirectly. We demonstrate that FPC stimulation decreases cognitive effort-based travel costs in an Effort Foraging Task, indicating a causal and general involvement of the FPC in motivating effortful behavior, highlighting the potential of tDCS as a new avenue for increasing motivation with potential clinical applications.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615537", "title": "Cortex-wide spatiotemporal motifs of theta oscillations are coupled to freely moving behavior", "authors": "Sattler, N.

Dynamic AMPAR trafficking is a major component of synaptic plasticity, such as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) and is thought to be required for learning and memory. Dramatic alteration of endosomal pH has been reported to negatively affect synaptic transmission and neural development, but the underlying mechanisms by which pH is involved in AMPAR trafficking are unclear. Here, we show that the proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel localizes to early and recycling endosomes along neuronal dendrites and prevents hyper-acidification of endosomes. To directly measure AMPAR endocytosis, we used a new method to assess LTD using HaloTag-GluA2 and found that the loss of PAC reduces AMPAR internalization during chemical LTD in primary neurons, while AMPAR trafficking in unstimulated cells or during chemical LTP is unaffected. Consistently, pyramidal neuron-specific PAC knockout mice had impaired hippocampal LTD, but not LTP, and performed poorly in the Morris water maze reversal test, exhibiting an inability to adapt to changing environments (also referred to as behavioral flexibility). We conclude that proper maintenance of pH by PAC is important during LTD to regulate AMPAR trafficking in a manner critical for animal physiology and behavior.\n\nSummaryThe ability to adapt to changing environments stems from the plasticity of neurons, which can modulate their synaptic strength in response to neural activity. We discovered a novel mechanism by which an endosomal proton-activated chloride channel (PAC) is involved in synaptic weakening, or long-term depression (LTD). To improve tools used to study LTD, we developed a live-cell imaging assay to directly observe -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis. PAC-deficient neurons have hyper-acidified endosomes and fail to endocytose AMPARs during LTD. Neuron-specific PAC knockout mice have impaired hippocampal LTD and fail to adapt to changes in their environment. The role of endosomal pH in synaptic function is understudied, and our results provide a novel mechanism whereby PAC can affect synaptic LTD.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615483", "title": "The oneirogen hypothesis: modeling the hallucinatory effects of classical psychedelics in terms of replay-dependent plasticity mechanisms", "authors": "Bredenberg, C.; Normandin, F.; Richards, B.; Lajoie, G.", "author_corresponding": "Colin Bredenberg", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Montreal", "date": "2024-09-30", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/30/2024.09.27.615483.source.xml", "abstract": "Classical psychedelics induce complex visual hallucinations in humans, generating percepts that are coherent at a low level, but which have surreal, dream-like qualities at a high level.

In this work, we propose the \"oneirogen hypothesis\", which posits that the perceptual effects of classical psychedelics are a result of their pharmacological actions inducing neural activity states that truly are more similar to dream-like states. We simulate classical psychedelics effects via manipulating neural network models trained on perceptual tasks with the Wake-Sleep algorithm. This established machine learning algorithm leverages two activity phases, a perceptual phase (wake) where sensory inputs are encoded, and a generative phase (dream) where the network internally generates activity consistent with stimulus-evoked responses. We simulate the action of psychedelics by partially shifting the model to the  Sleep state, which entails a greater influence of top-down connections, in-line with the impact of psychedelics on apical dendrites. The effects resulting from this manipulation capture a number of experimentally observed phenomena including the emergence of hallucinations, increases in stimulus-conditioned variability, and large increases in synaptic plasticity.

Here, we found that activation of IRE1 in infected lungs compromises immunity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-induced primary and secondary pneumonia.

This work introduces a novel mechanically heterogeneous environment, with alternating soft and stiff microdomains, to mimic the complex mechanical signals T cells face.

Interestingly, long-term exposure to these patterns enhances the proliferation of central memory and effector T cell phenotypes, similar to stiff environments.

Recently, a clinical study showed that patients with mutations causative of BOR also present with craniosynostosis, indicating that this could be an undiagnosed feature of BOR. Approximately half of all patients presenting with BOR have a variant in either SIX1 or its activating co-factor EYA1. The genes underlying BOR in the other 50% of patients remain unknown. To date, most studies on the role of SIX1 in the inner ear have focused on its role in the placode-based development of the sensorineural epithelia (cochlear and vestibular organs), as sensorineural hearing loss has long term effects on human health and development. The role of SIX1 in the neural crest cells (NCCs) of the first pharyngeal (a.k.a., mandibular) arch, which will give rise to the upper and lower jaws as well as the middle ear ossicles which may be affected in patients with BOR, is less well understood. To that end, we examine herein the role of three proteins that have been identified in Xenopus laevis as SIX1 co-factors to determine whether their function as regulators of SIX1+EYA transcriptional activity is conserved in mouse and begin to elucidate their function in the NCCs of the mandibular arch. Our data reveal that SIX1 is co-expressed with PA2G4, MCRS1, and SOBP within the oral domain of the mandibular arch, although each has a very distinct expression pattern. We further demonstrate that MCRS1 and SOBP are bona fide SIX1 co-factors that can repress SIX1+EYA transcriptional activity. PA2G4, on the other hand, does not bind to SIX1 in the mouse but can indirectly enhance the transcriptional activity of the SIX1+EYA transcriptional complex. Further, we show that both MCRS1 and SOBP are also able to translocate EYA to the nucleus via direct (i.e., SOBP) or indirect (i.e., MCRS1) mechanisms. We also show that later, during development of the mandible and incisors that SOBP is co-expressed with SIX1 within these anlagen, confirming the biological relevance of these transcriptional complexes in craniofacial bone formation and within the derivatives of the mandibular NCCs. This study, therefore, highlights the complexity of SIX1+EYA transcriptional regulation suggesting that there are multiple, and potentially redundant, mechanisms in place to ensure precise levels of SIX1+EYA transcriptional activity during craniofacial development.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615391", "title": "On the diversity of nematode antagonists in an agricultural soil, and their steerability by root-knot nematode density and cover crops", "authors": "Cazzaniga, S.

Within this category, root-knot nematodes (RKN, Meloidogyne spp.) are worldwide regarded as the most impactful because of their wide geographical distribution and their polyphagous nature. Host plant resistances against RKN have been successfully introduced in a few crops only. As the use of nematicides is becoming increasingly restricted because of environmental and human health concerns, there is a need for alternative strategies to control RKN. One such approach is the stimulation of local nematode antagonists. We investigated this in an experimental field setting with two main variables: density of the Columbia root-knot nematode Meloidogyne chitwoodi, and the type of cover of crop. For each of the three M. chitwoodi densities, the effects of ten cover crop treatments were tested on both the resident (DNA) and the active (RNA) fractions of the bacterial and fungal communities. In our analyses, we focussed on changes in the abundance of plant-parasitic nematode antagonists. From the eight bacterial and 26 fungal genera known from global literature to harbour potential antagonists of plant-parasitic nematodes, we detected respectively five and 14 genera in our agricultural field. Among the bacterial genera, four included bacterial species for which nematode antagonism has been documented. The fungal genera included facultative nematode parasites (e.g., Arthrobotrys spp.), endophytes strengthening host defences (e.g., Acremonium spp.), as well as multiple obligatory nematophagous species. This study revealed that conventionally managed arable fields may harbour an unexpectedly high diversity of nematode antagonists. Multiple antagonists were stimulated by cover crops in a cover crop-specific manner, and, to a lesser extent, by increased RKN densities. The richness in putative nematode antagonists did not translate into M. chitwoodi suppression probably because most antagonists have a facultative nematophagous lifestyle and will only predate nematodes under poorer nutritional conditions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615469", "title": "A novel degenerate primer set for eDNA metabarcoding of amphibians, turtles and fish", "authors": "Rodgers, T.

However, the effects of hypoxia on early life stages (e.g., larvae and juveniles) are largely unknown, and it is unclear how evolutionary and life histories may influence these outcomes. Here, we addressed this question by comparing hypoxia responses across early life stages of three cnidarian species representing a range of life histories: the reef-building coral Galaxea fascicularis, a broadcast spawner with horizontal transmission of endosymbiotic algae (family Symbiodiniaceae); the reef-building coral Porites astreoides, a brooder with vertical endosymbiont transmission; and the estuarine sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a non-symbiotic broadcast spawner. Transient exposure of larvae to hypoxia (dissolved oxygen < 2 mg L-1 for 6 h) led to decreased larval swimming and growth for all three species, which resulted in impaired settlement for the corals. Coral-specific responses also included larval swelling, depressed respiration rates, and decreases in symbiont densities and function. These results indicate both immediate and latent negative effects of hypoxia on cnidarian physiology and coral-algal mutualisms specifically. In addition, G. fascicularis and P. astreoides were sensitized to heat stress following hypoxia exposure, suggesting that the combinatorial nature of climate stressors will lead to declining performance for corals. However, sensitization to heat stress was not observed in N. vectensis exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this species may be more resilient to combined stressors.

Among the other histories expected to occur are those attributable to deep coalescence/lineage sorting; to biological causes such as introgression and horizontal transfer; or to pseudo-orthology, long branch attraction, and other technical issues. Gene tree topology space is the portion of tree space occupied by the gene trees reconstructed for a particular dataset of sampled genetic loci. Because coalescent theory predicts that the species tree topology will generally be the most frequent among gene trees, a reasonable expectation is that there will be a peak in gene tree topology space at the species tree topology, with secondary peaks present due to trees tracking other histories. Gene tree topology space in the small ([~]30 species, including the cultivated soybean) legume genus, Glycine should not only have signals from the species tree and from lineage sorting, but also from a likely introgression event that created incongruence between the plastid and nuclear genomes. Additionally, Glycine is the product of a relatively recent (<13 million years) whole genome duplication, raising the possibility of pseudo-orthology. We explored this space using a set of 2389 nuclear genes and representative accessions from a 570-taxon concatenation tree, reconstructing gene trees for all nuclear loci and from complete plastid genomes and partial mitochondrial genomes. Species trees (ASTRAL) and maximum likelihood (ML) concatenation trees were congruent for a 61-taxon dataset but were incongruent with organellar genome trees. Gene tree topology space was flat: No topology was represented by more than one gene tree. This was also true for a reduced dataset of 27 taxa; only when the dataset was reduced to six ingroup taxa were multiple gene trees having the species tree topology observed, along with a topology congruent with the chloroplast genome topology, presumably representing nuclear loci introgressed along with the plastome. Clustering failed to identify any regional differentiation of gene tree topology space populated by loci with similar topologies. Pseudo-orthology did not contribute meaningfully to incongruence, in agreement with recent modeling work that minimizes concerns about this phenomenon.

Applying this to yeast spores by flow cytometry has already been proved to be highly efficient, but manual analyses of density distributions of signal intensities is time-consuming and produces non-perfectly reproducible results.

This study aimed to determine if antelope ground squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus; AGS), a naturally diurnal rodent, can also shift their activity patterns to cyclic aversive stimuli. We conducted two experiments with 20 AGS housed in custom cages featuring a safe nesting area and a separate foraging area (for feeding and drinking), rendered aversive by presentation of unsignaled, time-specific footshocks. In the first experiment, animals were subjected to a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle. One group experienced aversion during the light phase, while the control group received the same treatment during the dark phase. In the second experiment, a 16:8 LD cycle was used, and animals were divided into three groups with the foraging area rendered aversive either during the first or second half of the light phase or during the dark phase. Following each of these treatments, animals were released into constant darkness (DD) to assess the phase and period of free-running rhythms. Contrary to previous findings in nocturnal rodents, AGS did not exhibit consistent shifts in activity to avoid footshocks. Most animals maintained their normal diurnal activity, with only minor and inconsistent phase shifts. In experiment two, animals exposed to footshocks during half of the light phase also failed to reliably shift activity to the opposite \"safe\" portion of the light phase. Together, these findings show AGS lack the ability to entrain to cyclic aversive stimuli or become nocturnal; this result suggests a lack of substantial plasticity in activity timing.

This study utilizes Raman spectroscopy coupled with biaxial inflation testing to investigate changes in the murine uterus with age (2-3 months, 4-6 months, 10-12 months, and 20-24 months). Linear and toe moduli significantly decreased with reproductive aging (2 to 12 months); however, moduli increased in the oldest age group (20-24 months). The optical signature of combined elastin and collagen content was significantly higher in the oldest group (20-24 month), while the glycogen contribution was the highest in the 2-3 month murine uterus.

Determining the stimulus frequency resulting in the lowest seizure threshold could produce fewer adverse effects by reducing the overall stimulus intensity. To determine the optimal frequency for seizure induction, four male rhesus macaques were titrated with an increasing number of pulses at fixed frequencies ranging from 5 to 240 pulses per second (pps) using ultrabrief-pulse right-unilateral ECT and circular-coil-on-vertex MST. The seizure threshold dependence on stimulus frequency was similar for ECT and MST. While higher frequencies required progressively shorter trains to induce a seizure, the middle frequency range was associated with the fewest pulses (and hence the least charge and energy), with a minimum at 16 pps and similarly low thresholds for 10 and 25 pps. The number of pulses at seizure threshold increased markedly at lower and higher frequencies. The lowest stimulus frequencies, 5 and 10 pps, were associated with the greatest ictal power measured by electroencephalography.

Here, we identified GRNs by integrating gene expression (GE) and chromatin accessibility data derived from functionally defined cell populations enriched for HSC and LSC. We analyzed n=32 LSC+ and n=32 LSC-cell fractions from n=22 AML patients, along with n=7 stem and n=10 progenitor enriched cell populations sorted from human umbilical cord blood (hUCB), producing a database of n{approx}17,000 transcription factor (TF) regulatory interactions for hUCB-HSPC and AML. We developed an iterative algorithm that associates the degree of chromatin openness with TF binding preferences, and the GE of candidate TF and target genes within 100kb upstream of transcription start sites. A putative regulatory structure was found to be enriched in HSC-enriched cell populations, comprising TF-target gene interactions between ETS1, EGR1, RUNX2, and ZNF683 oriented in a self-reinforcing configuration. A regulatory loop comprising FOXK1 and MEIS1, rather than the 4-factor HSC subnetwork, was detected in the LSC-specific GRN. The core HSC and LSC TF networks were extended using protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to determine connectivity with interacting genes whose expression strongly associated with LSC/HSC frequency estimates, producing a database of n=103,516 PPI target pathways. The effect of perturbing genes along the identified pathways on functional HSC and LSC frequency was predicted based on statistical regression analyses. To validate GRN predictions, we used pharmacologic and CRISPR targeting, in addition to re-examining published functional data associated with several network nodes that were predicted to impact stemness. Notably, we found that inhibition of CDK6 in AML samples markedly reduced LSC numbers as assessed in de novo serial xenotransplantation studies (fold change {approx} 10), as predicted by the LSC GRN model. Additionally, in-house CRISPR-based knockdown of ETS1 resulted in a significant decrease in HSC quiescence-associated microRNA-126 expression, and increased HSC frequency. Taken together, our models provide a comprehensive view of the underlying regulatory structures governing functional human HSC and LSC.

This paper investigates the competitive adsorption of a mAb and the amphiphilic surfactants poloxamer 188 (P188) and polysorbate 20 (PS20), both of which are commonly used to prevent mAb surface adsorption. Firstly, it is studied whether these surfactants prevent mAb adsorption, and secondly, whether it is possible to desorb mAb molecules from the air-water interface by surfactant addition. For surface pressure and surface tension data, Langmuir film balance measurements and drop shape tensiometry were used. Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (IRRAS) provided information on the surface composition, including the amount of adsorbed molecules. P188 exists in different self-assembled phases depending on its surface concentration. Our experiments show that the phase state of P188 has a significant impact on mAb adsorption. The presence of P188 in the brush phase ([&ge;] 0.3 mg/L) consistently inhibits mAb adsorption. On the contrary, addition of P188 after mAb film formation could not cause desorption of mAb. However, addition of PS20 leads to desorption of freshly formed interfacial mAb layers of up to two hours age. Interestingly, an aged mAb layer of 17 hours could not be desorbed by PS20. This suggests a time dependent reorganization of mAb at the air-water interface, which increases its resistance to desorption.

By understanding individual fission and fusion events in terms of active mechano-chemical cycles, we show how such trafficking manifests at the hydrodynamic scale, resulting not only in fluxes of material-- such as membrane area and encapsulated volume-- but also in active stresses that drive momentum transfer between an organelle and its cytosolic environment.

In this study, we addressed this knowledge gap by imaging the molecular organization of TLR4 and Fc{gamma}R on the macrophage cell surface and correlating it with their synergistic co-activation using ligands functionalized on lipid bilayers. We confirmed that co-activation of TLR4 and Fc{gamma}R enhances whole-cell pro-inflammatory responses and tyrosine phosphorylation at the receptor level.

Contrary to previous assumptions that TLR4 and Fc{gamma}R form heterodimers during their crosstalk, our results emphasize the critical role of receptor nanocluster interactions in modulating innate immune responses. Additionally, these findings align with similar receptor interaction mechanisms that we previously reported in other receptor pairs, such as Dectin-1/TLR2 and Fc{gamma}R/TLR2, suggesting that nanocluster interactions may represent a predominant mechanism governing crosstalk between TLRs and ITAM-containing receptors.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615443", "title": "Latent-TGF-\u03b2 has a domain swapped architecture", "authors": "Jin, M.; Seed, R.; Shing, T.; Cheng, Y.; Nishimura, S.", "author_corresponding": "Yifan Cheng", "author_corresponding_institution": "UCSF/HHMI", "date": "2024-09-30", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/30/2024.09.27.615443.source.xml", "abstract": "The multifunctional cytokine TGF-{beta} is produced in a latent form (L-TGF-{beta}) where a RGD containing homodimeric prodomain forms a \"ring\" encircling mature TGF-{beta} shielding it from its receptors.

This comprehensive approach allowed us to identify distinct NEPC subpopulations and their respective lineage with high confidence.\n\nKey Findings and LimitationsWe uncovered N-Myc and REST as key transcription factors driving distinct neuroendocrine subtypes among 5,797 neuroendocrine-like epithelial cells in CRPC: a REST-dependent subtype (NE I), an N-Myc-dependent subtype (NE II), and a combined N-Myc/REST subtype (NE I+II). These subtypes were validated using multiplex immunofluorescence staining. Trajectory analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, along with multi-omics time course analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data recapitulated N-Myc and REST lineages. Additionally, we observed PSMA loss in N-Myc lineage NEPC and identified STMN1 as a biomarker for PSMA-negative subtype. We validated the prognostic value of STMN1 using the TCGA dataset and 60 in-house CRPC tissues.

To study the particular effect of heatwaves in orchards, where soil-drought can be mitigated by irrigation, we propose a heatwave definition that focuses on atmospheric stress and its consequences, by relating the intensity of high VPD events to losses in tree stem-water storage (StWS). We found that the sensitivity and resilience of StWS to heatwaves is species-specific, and varies among species with different water-management strategies (e.g., isohydric orange and anisohydric mango trees, p < 10-3). Navel orange trees were sensitive to heatwaves starting at the 80th percentile of VPD in early spring, and once irrigation began, despite the harsh Mediterranean summer temperatures, StWC increased to 0.57 g cm-3, slightly greater than the StWC of the earlier wet season (approximately 0.55 g cm-3). Oppositely, there was a net reduction in StWC in Shelly mango trees from 0.75 to 0.69 g cm-3 between the two seasons, as sensitivity to heatwaves increased from the 90th to the 80th percentile in spring and summer, respectively. By first quantifying heatwaves and relating this new variable to changes in StWS, we were able to describe the sensitivity of each species according to the rarity of the heatwave events by VPD percentile, and their resilience to heatwaves over seasons based on the corresponding net changes in StWC.

We reveal that the annual mean temperature is the primary factor influencing the potential distribution of cultivated grapes (V. vinifera L.).

For example, under RCP 8.5, North American wild grapes like V. rotundifolia and V. labrusca, as well as East Asian wild grapes such as V. heyneana and V. davidii, are projected to demonstrate significant adaptability. These wild grapes have the potential to provide rootstocks that could enhance the adaptability of cultivated grapes and serve as invaluable resources for breeding programs aimed at developing new cultivars better suited to withstand the environmental pressures of climate change.

Differential thermal analysis was used to track changes in cold hardiness and deacclimation resistance was assessed throughout the season to track dormancy progression.

It is thought that a signal arising from the adipose microenvironment triggers APC differentiation; yet the identity and source of the signal remains unknown. This study sought to uncover the signal responsible for activating adipogenesis. Redox signaling was shown to influence adipogenesis in primary murine APCs treated with pharmacologic agents to manipulate the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased generation of superoxide (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via redox cyclers amplified both early and late APC differentiation, while ROS scavengers and antioxidants blunted differentiation. The impact of specifically targeting H2O2 with the antioxidant, catalase, or a catalase inhibitor, was restricted to lipid accumulation in late adipogenesis. Protein was concentrated from conditioned media of adipose tissue explants cultured ex vivo to capture signals within the adipose secretome. Differentiation was enhanced in APCs cultured in the presence of the adipose secretome, an effect that was diminished with scavenging of ROS and amplified when the secretome was collected from mice fed a high fat diet for 8 weeks. Proteomic analysis revealed that the adipose secretome from animals on a high fat diet was enriched in pathways related to immune cell-mediated inflammation, with interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a central regulator of differentially expressed proteins. A multiplex assay to measure cytokines confirmed higher IL-6 in the adipose secretome of high fat-fed animals. Exposure of APCs to IL-6 increased adipogenesis, while treatment of APCs with an IL-6 blocking antibodies diminished the adipogenic effect of the adipose secretome. Together, these findings substantiate a role for redox signaling in the regulation of adipogenesis and identify IL-6 as a novel activator of adipogenesis that may mediate APC differentiation via generation of ROS under obesogenic conditions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.28.615624", "title": "Test-Retest Reliability and repeatability of Behavioral and Electrophysiological Markers in an Eriksen Flanker Task", "authors": "Bogdanov, M.; Scott, J.

Inhibiting D1-neurons at -5 sec or D2-neurons at -2.5 sec, but not at other timepoints, reduced sucrose-motivated lever-pressing. We propose that the time-specific activity of D1- and D2-neurons mediate key temporal features of the NAc through which reward motivation initiates reward-seeking behavior.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.29.614220", "title": "Levodopa impairs lysosomal function in sensory neurons in vitro", "authors": "Olaoye, O.

Patients are diagnosed based upon movement disorders, including bradykinesia, tremor and stiffness of movement. However, non-motor signs, including constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, smell deficits and pain are well recognized. Peripheral neuropathy is also increasingly recognized, as the vast majority of patients show reduced intraepidermal nerve fibers, and sensory nerve conduction and sensory function is also impaired. Many case studies in the literature show that high-dose levodopa, the primary drug used in the treatment of PD, may exacerbate neuropathy, thought to involve levodopas metabolism to homocysteine. Here, we treated primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia and a sensory neuronal cell line with levodopa to examine effects on cell morphology, mitochondrial content and physiology, and lysosomal function. High-dose levo-dopa reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. At concentrations observed in the patient, levo-dopa enhanced immunoreactivity to beta III tubulin. Critically, levodopa reduced lysosomal content and also reduced the proportion of lysosomes that were acidic while homocysteine tended to have the opposite effect. Levodopa is a critically important drug for the treatment of PD. However, our data suggests that at concentrations observed in the patient, it has deleterious effects on sensory neurons that are not related to homocysteine.\n\nSimple SummaryParkinsons disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic, degenerative brain diseases worldwide. Patients are diagnosed on the basis of slowness of movement and/or tremor and/or stiffness. However, many symptoms that are not movement related are now well recognized. Patients show changes in skin sensation, and the vast majority of patients show loss of sensory neurites, which enable sensation in skin. These changes in skin sensation occur prior to diagnosis; however, sensory issues may also be exacerbated by levodopa, an important drug used in the treatment of PD. Undoubtedly, levodopa is critical for the treatment of PD, but at high doses, it has repeatedly been shown to impair sensation in PD patients. Here, we show for the first time that high-dose levodopa impairs function of sensory neurons. Importantly, we also show for the first time that lysosomes, a critical organelle involved in recycling, are impaired by levodopa concentrations observed in patients. These data are important given the well-known lysosomal dysfunction observed in PD. Our data sheds light on how levodopa, the most important drug in the treatment of PD, may contribute to sensory deficits in PD.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615501", "title": "A rich conformational palette underlies human CaV2.1-channel availability", "authors": "Wang, K.; Nilsson, M.; Angelini, M.; Olcese, R.; Elinder, F.; Pantazis, A.", "author_corresponding": "Antonios Pantazis", "author_corresponding_institution": "Linkoping University", "date": "2024-09-30", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/30/2024.09.27.615501.source.xml", "abstract": "Depolarization-evoked opening of CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+-channels triggers neurotransmitter release, while voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) limits channel availability to open, contributing to synaptic plasticity.

A clinical herpes vaccine is still lacking. In the present study, a novel prime/pull/keep vaccine was tested in Human Leukocyte Antigen transgenic rabbit model of ocular herpes (HLA-A*0201 Tg rabbit). Ten asymptomatic (ASYMP) CD8+ T cell peptide epitopes and 3 CD4+ T-cell epitopes were selected from the HSV-1 glycoproteins D and B (gD and gB), viral tegument proteins (VP11/12 and VP13/14) and the DNA replication binding helicase (UL9), all preferentially recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells from \"naturally protected\" HSV-1-seropositive healthy ASYMP individuals (who never had recurrent corneal herpetic disease). HLA Tg rabbits were ocularly infected with HSV-1 then during latency at day 30 post-infection, the rabbits were ocularly vaccinated with a recombinant neurotropic AAV8 vector (107GC/ eye) encoding for the 10 CD8+ T cell peptide and 4 CD4+ T cells peptide (prime), T cell-attracting CXCL-11 (Pull) and T-cell keeping IL-2/IL-15 cytokines (keep). The rabbits were followed up for eye disease and viral loads in tears for 28 days. The frequency, function and protective efficacy of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells induced by the prime/pull/keep vaccine were assessed in the trigeminal ganglia (TG), cornea, Spleen, and peripheral blood. Compared to the mock group (unvaccinated), the peptides/CXCL11/IL-2/IL-15 vaccine generated frequent resident CD8+ T cells that infiltrated the TG. CD8+ T cells mobilization and retention into TG of prime/pull/keep vaccinated rabbits was associated with a significant reduction in corneal herpes infection and disease after an ocular HSV-1 challenge (McKrae). These findings draw attention to the novel prime/pull/keep therapeutic vaccine strategy to mobilize and retain anti-viral T cells into tissues protecting them against herpetic infection and disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEThere is an urgent need for a vaccine against widespread human herpes simplex virus infections. The present study demonstrates that immunization of humanized HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits with CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitope peptides (prime)/ CXCL11 (pull)/ IL-2/IL-15 (Keep) AAV8-based vaccine triggered mobilization ad retention of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells locally in the cornea and TG, the sites of acute and latent herpes infections. Mobilization and retention of antiviral CD8+ T cells into cornea and TG of HSV-1 infected rabbits that received the prime/pull/keep vaccine was associated with protection against ocular herpes infection and disease.

As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.\n\nMethodsTo generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we utilized mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays (TMAs) that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).\n\nResultsWe made three specific observations: 1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 micrometers from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. 2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared to normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced Overall Survival (OS) and reduced progression-free survival (PFS) in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. 3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).\n\nConclusionOur study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.\n\nKey MessagesWhat is already known on this topic: Hypoxia significantly impairs T cell functions, including reduced proliferation and cytokine production. This impairment may contribute to immune evasion and resistance to immune therapies, such as ICIs, adoptive transfer of TILs, and Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells. Despite the established impact of hypoxia on T cell function, the precise spatial distribution of T cells in relation to oxygen availability within the TME and how this affects clinical outcomes in melanoma patients remains unclear. Additionally, the specific transcriptional changes in T cells induced by hypoxia and their prevalence in different T cell states, as well as the implications for resistance to ICIs, have not been thoroughly investigated. Understanding these aspects is crucial for developing targeted therapies to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance and improve immunotherapy efficacy.\n\nWhat this study adds: This study elucidates the profound impact of hypoxia on T cells in melanoma. Our findings reveal that T cells accumulate in well-oxygenated regions near blood vessels, whereas hypoxic conditions significantly impair their proliferation and cytokine production. By addressing the transcriptional changes induced by hypoxia, we demonstrated its prevalence in resting and non-activated T cells and TSTR. Moreover, we found that hypoxia is associated with shorter OS and PFS in melanoma patients, particularly in non-responders to ICIs. This research highlights the critical role of hypoxia in modulating T cell spatial behavior, contributing to immune evasion and poor clinical outcomes in melanoma.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice, or policy: The findings emphasizes hypoxias critical role in modulating T cell behavior and its potential as a biomarker for treatment outcomes. These insights could inform the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at improving T cell function in hypoxic TMEs, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies for melanoma and other solid tumors.

B7-H4 is minimally expressed in normal tissues but is highly expressed by various cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Despite its importance as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, no imaging techniques specifically targeting B7-H4 have been established. To close this gap, we sought to assess the ability of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) based immunoPET radiotracer to visualize B7-H4 in human and murine prostate cancer models.\n\nMethodsAnti-B7-H4 mAb clone 2H9 was functionally characterized for binding to the human and mouse B7-H4 protein. The antibody was conjugated with chelator p-SCN-Bn-Deferoxamine (DFO) and labeled with radioisotope Zirconium-89 (89Zr) to obtain immunoPET tracer 89Zr-2H9-mAb. The biolayer interferometry method was used to test the binding kinetics of DFO-2H9-mAb compared to that of parental 2H9 mAb. A group of six athymic nude mice with human DU145 prostate tumor xenograft underwent MicroPET imaging after tail vein injection of [~]150{micro}Ci 89Zr-2H9-mAb or non-binding 89Zr-Isotype-mAb. Next, immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice with TRAMP-C2 tumors each were injected with either PBS (n=8), cold 2H9 mAb (10mg/kg) to block B7-H4 (n=6), or chlodronate liposome (15mg/kg) to cause total macrophage depletion (n=6), followed by 89Zr-2H9-mAb MicroPET imaging. An ex vivo biodistribution assay was performed after 144 hr post radiotracer injection. Tumor radiotracer binding, quantified as a percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), was compared between different experimental groups using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni or Tukey corrections.\n\nResultsImmunoconjugation yielded a 2.59 {+/-} 0.08 chelator-to-antibody ratio, and the binding of DFO conjugated 2H9-mAb was similar to that of parental 2H9 mAb, with unaffected affinity in targeting B7-H4 protein moiety. The radiochemical purity of 89Zr-2H9-mAb tracer was yielded >95% with an average specific activity of 5{micro}Ci/{micro}g antibody. DU145 tumor xenografts demonstrated significantly stronger radiotracer binding at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hr than the non-binding isotype control group. In TRAMP-C2 tumor xenografts, the radiotracer binding in B7-H4 blocked tumors was significantly lower than in the non-blocked PBS-injected group. Macrophage depletion resulted in a significant decrease in tumor binding compared to the control group. 89Zr-2H9-mAb could efficiently distinguish tumors with high sensitivity, showing a high correlation between PET imaging and bio-distribution. More importantly, the immunohistochemistry of the harvested tumor revealed no significant difference between the three groups, as discernible through in vivo PET imaging.\n\nConclusionThis study highlights the potential of B7-H4 immunoPET imaging for monitoring immunotherapy response. With the emerging potential of B7-H4 blocking as an immunotherapeutic, immunoPET imaging could be readily expanded to patient stratification and therapy monitoring. B7-H4 imaging could augment our understanding of B7-H4 dynamics in response to various therapeutic interventions in clinical trials.

SA colonization is dynamic, appearing and disappearing, with strains evolving and potentially shifting in composition over time and between body sites. These changes make detection challenging and the numerous potential sources of reintroduction from other people and even other body site reservoirs preclude efficient efforts to prevent transmission and spread. Identifying typical sources is therefore critical for mitigation. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), ideally of multiple colonies from multiple body sites, is the gold standard for characterizing SA strains and confirming transmission. However, this is often too resource-intensive for initial assessments of transmission and not feasible for large-scale studies involving various body sites from multiple individuals over time. To address these challenges, we developed a low-cost, custom, species-specific amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) assay, optimized to provide high resolution discrimination of SA genotypes directly from samples.\n\nWe tested this approach on a subset of samples that were a part of a large-scale longitudinal study of SA carriage. Oral and nasal samples were collected from 9 participants every two weeks for up to 18 weeks and qPCR positive samples were analyzed using our AmpSeq assay directly from the sample without culturing. The longitudinal sampling strategy enabled us to characterize changes in SA colonization patterns over time, detect potential strain mixtures, and identify rare variants that may serve as signatures of transmission between different body sites or among individuals. Without using WGS, we were able to rapidly eliminate the possibility of transmission between sampled residents. Participants that had positive oral and nasal samples had no fixed SNP differences between the two body sites, suggesting likely within-person spread. In these cases, we were able to infer the most likely direction of spread (nasal to oral sites) by analyzing segregating rare variants. While WGS can be used to provide higher resolution to colonization patterns and validate these findings, our amplicon sequencing approach offers a rapid, cost-effective, direct-from-sample method for species-specific screening intended for population-level characterization that allows researchers to characterize strain types, identify or eliminate likely transmission cases, and identify potential reservoirs before resorting to more expensive WGS methods.\n\nAuthors summaryColonizing opportunistic pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus present a unique challenge for disease study because rather than causing acute infections upon transmission, they persist asymptomatically for long periods of time allowing the bacterial population to evolve and differentiate. Characterizing the diversity within these populations is important for choosing correct treatments, quantifying the risk of horizontal gene transfer, and understanding paths of transmission between people and spread to different body sites. The gold-standard approach for characterizing population diversity is through culturing and whole-genome sequencing of multiple colonies per sample which is labor-intensive and expensive for any large-scale study. Using a custom-designed species-specific amplicon sequencing assay, we offer a cost-effective method for characterizing the diversity in Staphylococcus aureus populations directly from samples without the need for labor-intensive culturing or whole-genome sequencing. Our small-scale study highlights how this method provides a scalable tool for large epidemiological studies ideal for systematically exploring broader patterns of carriage and transmission.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615530", "title": "Microfluidic Formation of Ultrathin, Handleable Collagen Sheets Exhibiting Toe-heel Tensile Behavior", "authors": "Zhang, Y.; Malladi, S.; Wang, B.; Chaikof, E.; Guenther, A.", "author_corresponding": "Axel Guenther", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Toronto", "date": "2024-09-30", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "bioengineering", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/30/2024.09.27.615530.source.xml", "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) of cardiovascular tissues displays a non-linear, strain-dependent elastic modulus, attributed to the hierarchical organization of collagen.

Although collagen gels are widely used in 3D cell culture, tissue engineering, and biofabrication, current engineering techniques fail to replicate this hierarchical organization at the microscale. As a result, they lack both the non-linear tensile behavior and the physiologically relevant strength of native tissues. To address this limitation, we present templated collagen sheets that are 1.8 microns thin and 10 mm wide that demonstrate non-linear tensile behavior. Collagen sheets are obtained from an acidic collagen solution via a microfluidic flow focusing process, incorporating and subsequently removing emulsified oil droplets (mean diameters 2.1 microns and 5.0 microns, volume concentration 2.25%). Templated collagen sheets exhibit a two-fold increase in fibril alignment dispersion compared with non-templated ones. When assessed along their length, the Youngs modulus of templated sheets increases 62-fold at 90% failure strain, closely matching the properties of native load-bearing tissues.

Herein, we repurpose a newly identified post-transcriptional interaction between the uxuB leader sequence and the E. coli CsrA regulatory protein to design a biological post-transcriptional BANDPASS filter. In this work, we characterize the uxuB mRNA as heterogenous target of the Carbon Storage Regulatory A (CsrA) protein, where the protein can both activate and repress uxuB activity depending on its intracellular concentration. We leverage this interaction to implement a novel strategy of regulation within the 5UTR of an mRNA. Specifically, we report a hierarchical binding strategy that may be leveraged by CsrA within uxuB to result in a dose- dependent response in regulatory outcomes. In our semi-synthetic circuit, the uxuB mRNA leader sequence is used as a scaffold that is fused to a gene of interest, which allows the circuit to transition between ON/OFF states based on a range of free native concentration of the CsrA regulatory protein. Notably, this system exerts regulation comparable to previously developed transcriptional BANDPASS filters while reducing the number of circuit components and can be used in concert with additional controlled circuits to achieve complex multi-signal control.

The method is agnostic to isolation approaches as it is a physical biochemical separation to remove large and small debris that hinders high-resolution imaging. In addition to improving image quality and preservation of structural features, the method visualizes morphotypes not typically seen with conventional TEM imaging and enables capturing a particle library with both 2D and 3D information.

Physiological parameters analyzed included growth, photosynthesis, and antioxidative response. Reactive oxygen species generation and the chemical profile of the aqueous extracts were analyzed. At 4.0 g L-1, both extracts inhibited cyanobacterial growth in 6 days. P. stratiotes extract achieved 100% inhibition, while P. crassipes extract reached 60%. P. stratiotes extract showed higher photosynthetic inhibition (99% vs. 12% for P. crassipes). This was related to the downregulation of the psbA gene (coding for the photosystem II protein D1). Exposure to both extracts increased intracellular reactive oxygen species content in cyanobacterial cells and increased peroxiredoxin gene (prxA) transcripts. This response was not noted for sod (superoxide dismutase) transcripts, although SOD enzymatic activity increased in cultures exposed to P. stratiotes extracts.

To date, the production of OMVs has not been reported in the Chlorobiaceae within the phylum Chlorobiota. Chlorobaculum. tepidum is the model organism for the Chlorobiaceae that synthesizes and consumes insoluble extracellular sulfur (S(0)) globules by an unknown mechanism. Here, we report evidence implicating outer membrane vesicles in biogenic S(0) globule synthesis. First we demonstrate that Cba. tepidum secretes OMVs in the extracellular milieu, and that OMV yield and size vary with growth conditions, particularly sulfide concentration. A core of 28 proteins involved in diverse biological processes such as cell wall biogenesis, inorganic ion transport and metabolism were found to be shared between OMVs, extracellular S(0) globules and Cba. tepidum intact cells. Multiple analytical methods indicated that OMVs contain S(0) and that OMVs and biogenic S(0) globules share protein and polysaccharide signatures, including lipooligosaccharides. Together these lines of evidence indicate that Cba. tepidums OMVs are one component of sulfur transport between cells and extracellular sulfur globules.\n\nIMPORTANCEAll living cells must exchange material with their environment while maintaining cellular integrity. This is a particular challenge for materials that are not water soluble, yet many bacteria utilize insoluble materials for energy conservation and as nutrients for growth. Here we show that Cba. tepidum makes outer membrane vesicles and that these vesicles are likely involved in the exchange of material with extracellular elemental sulfur globules formed and consumed by Cba. tepidum as part of its energy metabolism based on oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds like hydrogen sulfide. These data expand our basic understanding of Cba. tepidums metabolism. As elemental sulfur is an industrial by-product with a limited number of uses, the information here may help enable the use of additional sulfur compounds by Cba. tepidum to drive the synthesis of biomass and/or specialty biochemicals from waste elemental sulfur by this autotrophic bacterium.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615839", "title": "Dietary L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) augments cuticular melanization in Anopheles mosquitos while reducing their lifespan and malaria parasite burden", "authors": "Camacho, E.; Dong, Y.; Chrissian, C.; Cordero, R.

Here, we isolated and characterized a novel F. prausnitzii strain (UT1) that belongs to the most prevalent but underappreciated phylogenetic clade in the global human population. Genome analysis showed that this butyrate-producing isolate carries multiple putative mobile genetic elements, a clade-specific defense system, and a range of carbohydrate catabolic enzymes. Multiomic approaches were used to profile the impact of UT1 on the gut microbiome and associated metabolic activity of C57BL/6 mice at homeostasis. Both 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing demonstrated that oral administration of UT1 resulted in profound microbial compositional changes including a significant enrichment of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Turicibacter. Functional profiling of the fecal metagenomes revealed a markedly higher abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in UT1-gavaged mice. Accordingly, UT1-conditioned gut microbiota possessed the elevated capability of utilizing starch in vitro and exhibited a lower availability of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates in the feces. Further analysis uncovered a functional network wherein UT1 reduced the abundance of mucin-degrading CAZymes and microbes, which correlated with a concomitant reduction of mucin glycans in the gut.

First, 23 CRKP clinical isolates were characterized using Multi-locus Sequence Typing (MLST), carbapenemase test, string test, and capsule typing.

Host spectrum analysis revealed that each phage selectively lysed strains sharing the same STs as their hosts, indicating ST-specific activity. These phages were subtyped based on their host spectrum and RAPD-PCR, identifying nine and five groups, respectively. Fourteen phages were selected for further analysis using TEM and WGS, revealing 13 Myoviruses and one Podovirus.

Transmembrane transcriptional regulators (TTRs) are a subset of transcriptional regulators in bacteria that can directly regulate gene expression while remaining anchored in the membrane. Whether this constraint impacts the ability of TTRs to bind their DNA targets remains unclear. Vibrio cholerae uses two TTRs, ChiS and TfoS, to activate horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation in response to chitin by inducing the tfoR promoter (PtfoR). While TfoS was previously shown to bind and regulate PtfoR directly, the role of ChiS in PtfoR activation remains unclear. Here, we show that ChiS directly binds PtfoR upstream of TfoS, and that ChiS directly interacts with TfoS. By independently disrupting ChiS-PtfoR and ChiS-TfoS interactions, we show that ChiS-PtfoR interactions play the dominant role in PtfoR activation. Correspondingly, we show that in the absence of ChiS, recruitment of the PtfoR locus to the membrane is sufficient for PtfoR activation when TfoS is expressed at native levels. Finally, we show that the overexpression of TfoS can bypass the need for ChiS for PtfoR activation. All together, these data suggest a model whereby ChiS both (1) recruits the PtfoR DNA locus to the membrane for TfoS and (2) directly interacts with TfoS to increase its local concentration near the membrane-proximal promoter.

In the case of antibiotic tolerance, antibiotics fail to kill the bacteria as their phenotypic state affords them protection from the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic. Antibiotic tolerance can affect an entire bacterial population, or a subset of cells known as persister cells. Interaction with the host induces the formation of persister cells in numerous pathogens, with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species production being heavily implicated in the collapse of bacterial energy levels and entrance into an antibiotic tolerant state. Here, we developed a high-throughput screen to identify energy modulators for intracellular S. aureus. The identified compound, KL1, increases intracellular bacterial energy and sensitizes the persister population to antibiotics, without causing cytotoxicity or bacterial outgrowth when used alone.

Our preliminary research indicated that NPC1L1 may play a negative regulatory role in osteogenic differentiation. In this study, using in vitro osteogenic differentiation experiment and mouse osteoporosis model, we showed here that NPC1L1 expression was downregulated during osteogenesis, and NPC1L1 knockdown significantly enhanced osteogenic differentiation ability of osteoblasts and delayed progress of osteoporosis. Mechanistically, through RNA sequencing, NPC1L1 was found regulate cholesterol metabolism rather than transportation. It increased 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) level through activating 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1), resulting in 27-OHC accumulation in osteoblasts and inhibition of osteogenesis. Moreover, C/EBP was proved mediated NPC1L1 promotes production of 27-OHC by Cyp27a1.

Even though methanogens from the archaeal orders Methanosarcinales and Methanococcales are unable to grow on sugars, they store glycogen, which is metabolized through the glycogenolysis and glycolytic pathways when the carbon source for methanogenesis is depleted. Under these metabolic conditions, the activity of the GP enzyme is essential. To be active, all phosphorylases characterized to date require the cofactor pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP). This cofactor is covalently bound via Schiff base to a strictly conserved lysine residue at the active site. Extensive GP sequence analysis of organisms from different domains of life shows strict conservation of active site residues despite significant differences in sequence length. Interestingly, in GP sequences of organisms from the order Methanococcales of archaea, a threonine residue replaces the conserved lysine involved in PLP binding. The purification and characterization of recombinant GP from Methanococcus maripaludis show that the enzyme exhibits glycogen phosphorylase activity and high specificity for glycogen as a substrate. Analysis of the PLP content performed by several methods, such as absorbance, fluorescence, cyanohydrin adduct formation, and mass spectrometry, confirmed the absence of PLP. The results demonstrate that an archaeal GP from the order Methanococcales performs catalysis without the PLP cofactor, deviating from the well-established phosphorylase catalytic mechanism and revealing new scenarios for the glucosyltransferase reaction. Moreover, analysis of enzyme regulation shows that the activity is affected by various molecules, including nucleotides, intermediates of carbon metabolism, and phosphate species. Most of these molecules have not previously been identified as regulators of glycogen phosphorylases in prokaryotes. These results suggest that other GPs from Methanococcales can undergo complex regulation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615029", "title": "Spatiotemporal properties of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neuron activation by sustained and bursting electrical microstimulation", "authors": "Hughes, C.; Stieger, K.

Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagens signature triple helical tertiary structure and higher-order assemblies. Herein, we demonstrate that crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine, amino acids present in native collagen, can covalently stabilize the triple helix in collagen mimetic peptides. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, we hypothesized that this reaction could be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This covalent capture strategy successfully stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC-type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine-Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation-{pi} pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self-assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, we demonstrate that Dopa-Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37 {degrees}C. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615873", "title": "Tissue-specific and spatially dependent metabolic signatures perturbed by injury in skeletally mature male and female C57Bl/6J mice", "authors": "Welhaven, H.

The P. falciparum Niemann-Pick Type C1-related (PfNCR1) transporter has been identified as a druggable target, as it is required for membrane homeostasis of the parasite.

The data suggest that PfNCR1 binds cholesterol and forms a cholesterol transport tunnel to modulate the composition of the parasite plasma membrane. Cholesterol efflux assays substantiate this as they show that PfNCR1 is an exporter capable of extruding cholesterol from the membrane.

Despite its importance, in vivo quantification of lactate using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has faced challenges, primarily due to the overlapping lipid signal at 1.3 ppm. Current clinical practice employs a long echo time to exploit differences in T2 relaxation between lactate and lipids; however, this approach significantly suppresses signals from other metabolites. Lipid has a notably different T1 relaxation time than lactate and other metabolites, which may be exploited by an inversion recovery sequence to better distinguish them. However, this method has not found wide use because of the loss of signal in other metabolites. Here we introduce a selective inversion pulse with a short echo time MRS method (SPIR-PRESS), which mitigates this issue. In phantom experiments, SPIR-PRESS successfully suppressed lipid signals that could be misinterpreted as lactate in short TE PRESS spectra, while maintaining sensitivity to the full metabolite profile. SPIR-PRESS demonstrated superior performance in quantifying lactate compared to long echo time PRESS, with [~] 60 % increase in sensitivity for lactate detection compared to conventional PRESS with a 288 ms TE. In a mouse glioma model, SPIR-PRESS clearly detected lactate and other key tumor metabolites (choline, creatine, NAA) in the tumor, which were not detectable in conventional long TE PRESS.

We hypothesized that RSV-mediated alteration in airway DNA methylation (DNAm) may play a role.\n\nObjectivesInvestigate the impact of early-life RSV infection on airway DNAm.\n\nMethodsOur study population consisted of children from the INSPIRE population-based birth cohort. Early-life infection with RSV was defined as infection not requiring clinical illness before age one year, ascertained through active and passive surveillance. Methylation was measured in DNA from nasal airway epithelial cells (NAECs) at ages two years (n=88) and six years (n=539). Bulk gene expression in NAECs was available in a subset of participants at age two years (n=54). In silico cell type deconvolution was used to infer cell type-specific associations in suprabasal, ciliated, and \"other\" cell types.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsWe identified 164 CpGs in ciliated cells and seven CpGs in suprabasal cells whose cell type-specific DNAm at age two years was associated with early-life RSV infection. The seven associations in suprabasal cells were still present at age six years and the directions of association replicated in in vitro infection of epithelial cells with RSV in air liquid interface cultures. DNAm levels at four of the seven CpGs identified in suprabasal cells correlated with the expression of their nearest genes in suprabasal cells, which included genes previously implicated in asthma-related diseases. The DNAm levels of these four CpGs and the expression of their nearest genes in suprabasal cells at age two years were also associated with recurrent wheezing at age four years.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate epigenetic changes in airway progenitor cells of children who have had RSV infection in the first year of life are conserved over time, associated with subsequent wheeze, have functional relevance, and replicate in in vitro infection in ALI cultures.

Although this approach is extremely useful, its use is limited to speciation events and does not account for genes following different evolutionary paths. Recently, an alternative methodology for the relative dating of evolutionary events has been proposed that considers the distribution of branch lengths across sets of gene trees. Here, we validate this methodology using a fossil-calibrated phylogeny and propose a model-based formalisation using a Bayesian framework. Our analyses revealed that the normalisation of the compared branch lengths with branch lengths of a shared reference clade results in narrower distributions, allowing the correct inference of the relative ordering of evolutionary events. Moreover, we show that distributions of normalised lengths can be modelled using gamma or lognormal distributions. Finally, we demonstrate that inference of the posterior distribution of the mode allows accurate relative age estimation, as assessed by a strong correlation with the molecular clock-dated tree.

In concordance with this, we observe an altered genetic landscape, characterized by a threefold reduction in the calculated frequency of biallelic intellectual disability in the population relative to other recessive disorders.

We propose a structure learning approach to infer an agents internal model, composed of a learning rule and an internal representation of the environment. Crucially, the combined contribution of these components -- rather than their individual contribution -- determines the overall optimality of the agents behavior. By exploring various combinations of learning rules and environment representations, we identify the most probable agent model structure for each individual. We apply this framework to analyze rats learning behavior in a free-choice task within a T-maze with return arms, evaluating different internal models based on optimal and suboptimal learning rules, along with multiple possible representations of the T-maze decision graph. Identifying the most likely agent model structure based on the rats behavioral data reveals that slower learning rats employed either a suboptimal or a moderately optimal agent model, whereas fast learners employ an optimal agent model. Using the inferred agent models for each rat, we explore the qualitative differences in their individual learning processes. Policy entropy, derived from the inferred agent models, also highlights variations in the balance between exploration and exploitation strategies among the rats. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches to addressing suboptimal behavior focus separately on either suboptimal learning rules or flawed environment representations. Our approach jointly models these components, revealing that suboptimal decisions can arise from complex interactions between learning rules and environment representations within an agents internal model.

This regional specialization has been explained theoretically as arising from constraints on connectivity and the physical geometry of the cortical sheet. In contrast, the structure of neural representations within a specific brain region is not well understood. Experimental and theoretical work has argued both for and against the existence of specialization at the level of single neurons, where single neurons might be specialized to encode only particular subsets of variables among those represented by the whole brain region. Here, we use artificial neural networks to study the emergence of this local structure and work to reconcile experimental results that show local structure in some cases but not in others. We show that specialization at the level of single neurons - that is, an explicitly modular representation - emerges to support context-dependent behavior, but only when the network starts from a specific representational geometry. We also outline cases in which either unstructured or population-level specialization (i.e., an implicitly modular representation) is learned. We show that both explicitly and implicitly modular solutions are abstract and allow for rapid learning and generalization on novel tasks as well as zero-shot transfer to novel stimuli. We further show that modular geometries facilitate the rapid learning of novel contexts that are related to previously seen contexts, while less structured geometries facilitate the rapid learning of novel unrelated contexts.

Targeting CD44 using siRNA or function-blocking antibodies, or degrading its ligand hyaluronic acid (HA), almost completely abolishes PDAC cell attachment.

Interestingly, WNT activation also triggers an early contraction of stem cell colonies, with increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, resulting to cellular morphological changes. Small molecule inhibitors and genetic approaches were applied to determine if contractility is related to mesoderm differentiation. Contrary to expectation, suppressing contractility accelerated differentiation; Bra/T induction was enhanced, and EMT initiated as early as 24 hrs post WNT activation. Conversely, expression of constitutively active Rho kinase or myosin light chain kinase, to increase contractility, efficiently blocked any induction of mesoderm, including EMT. Mechanistically, reduced contractility promoted active {beta}-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus.

Our study demonstrates that centrosomes primarily inhibit congression initiation when CENP-E is inactive or absent by regulating the activity of kinetochore components. Depleting centrioles via Plk4 inhibition allows chromosomes near acentriolar poles to initiate congression independently of CENP-E. In contrast, at centriolar poles high Aurora A activity enhances Aurora B activity, increasing phosphorylation of microtubule-binding proteins at kinetochores and preventing stable microtubule attachments in the absence of CENP-E. Conversely, inhibiting Aurora A reduces Aurora B activity, enabling congression initiation even without CENP-E.

Consequently, both the basal and the cytokine-induced apoptosis of cultured MIN6 cells and dispersed human islets were inhibited. Overexpression of Otub2 in MIN6 cells increase the mRNA levels of NKx6.1 and Glut2 and concomitantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (by 2-3-fold). The beneficial effects of Otub2 on {beta}-cell function was demonstrated by the phenotype of Otub2-/+ and Otub2-/- mice, which manifested impaired glucose tolerance and increased expression of NFkB target genes (e.g. IP-10, MCP-1 and IL-1{beta}). RNAseq analysis of pancreata derived from OTUB2 KO mice revealed reduced expression of genes that down regulate K+ transporters (e.g. Ank2, Cacna1a and Kcnab1) combined with an increase in oxidative phosphorylation related genes. Given that closure of K+ channels is crucial for insulin secretion, these results could account, at least in part, for the impaired GSIS in the OTUB2 KO mice. Indeed, mass-spectrometry analysis of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Otub2 revealed the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv9.3 as a major Otub2 binding-partner.

Following several failed attempts using the same reagents, we identified a protocol that achieved very high targeted integration of a 3.2 kb transgene into a single locus of a humanized mouse model of Down syndrome. Moreover, we demonstrate in multiple ways that this procedure directly generates numerous non-mosaic founder animals, which bred true to generate all transgenic progeny. In vitro fertilization of oocytes was followed by AAV-mediated delivery of donor sequence and electroporation of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, all parameters designed to promote early zygotic engineering (EZE). This strategy can obviate the need to breed mosaic animals for germline transmission and can enable engineering of difficult to breed animals. While efforts to improve genome engineering focus on reagents and delivery techniques, findings here suggest a narrow window of time in the early fertilized oocyte, likely before genome replication, is key to achieve both high integration efficiency and one-step generation of non-mosaic, engineered mice.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615691", "title": "Maternal high-fat, high-sucrose diet-induced excess adiposity is linked to placental hypoxia and disruption of fetoplacental immune homeostasis in late gestation", "authors": "Bellissimo, C.

Previous reports have suggested that obesity-associated placental malperfusion may trigger a state of fetoplacental hypoxia, contributing to adverse health outcomes within and beyond the perinatal period. However, many previous studies have relied on indirect measures of tissue oxygen saturation, including readouts influenced by external inflammatory stressors. Direct comparisons of tissue oxygen saturation at the uteroplacental interface in pregnancies complicated by excess adiposity are lacking. Here, we used a mouse model of chronic preconception high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet feeding to model the impacts of an obesogenic milieu on placental oxygenation near term gestation (E17.5). We found that both placental junctional and labyrinth zone tissues were relatively hypoxic in HFHS pregnancies compared to chow-fed controls (CON). However, this was not associated with enhanced HIF-1 expression in labyrinth tissues. Similarly, placentas from CON and HFHS dams did not exhibit gross differences in morphology or vessel density and pericyte coverage. However, HFHS placentas have a greater burden of histopathological lesions, including tissue calcification and fibrinoid deposition within the labyrinth zone. Calcified placental tissue coincided with the destruction of vasculosyncytial membranes and macrophage-dense foci, alongside altered expression of immunomodulatory and chemotactic cytokines within the labyrinth zone proteome, which differed in magnitude with fetal sex. While fetal growth was not markedly affected, fetuses from HFHS pregnancies exhibited higher levels of circulating IL-6, prolactin, CXCL1, and CCL2. Collectively, these data confirm that diet-induced maternal excess adiposity leads to a relative state of placental hypoxia, even in the absence of marked growth restriction or fetal demise. While this hypoxic state is not linked to gross morphological abnormalities, it is associated with a greater histopathological burden indicative of local malperfusion and inflammation, and an altered fetal inflammatory and endocrine milieu in late gestation.

Interestingly, LVs that remained in the terminal-ileum draining lymphatic vessels were specifically dysfunctional, and tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) formed in this location. TLOs in the terminal ileum are associated with ileitis in humans and mice. However, mice lacking S1PR1 did not develop obvious characteristics of ileitis. Sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SPHK1/2) are required for the synthesis of S1P, the ligand of S1PR1. Mice that lack Sphk1/2 in LECs recapitulate the LV and TLO phenotypes of mice that lack S1PR1. Mechanistically, S1PR1 regulates shear stress signaling and the expression of the valve-regulatory molecules FOXC2 and connexin-37. Importantly, Foxc2+/- mice, a model for lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome, also develop TLOs in the terminal ileum.

Cortical microtubules (CMTs) rapidly reorient in response to mechanical stress to align with the maximal tensile stress direction [7,8].

Brain imaging studies suggest that these differences may be related to atypical brain responses to social-affective cues, affecting both the experience of receiving touch and observing it in others. However, it remains unclear whether these atypical responses are limited to specific brain regions or represent broader alterations in brain connectivity. The current study investigated how the functional network architecture is modulated during touch observation associated with autism and explored the extent to which changes in this architecture are associated with individual differences in social touch preferences and social responsiveness. By integrating generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis with independent component analysis (ICA), the current study analyzed existing fMRI datasets, in which 21 autistic and 21 non-autistic male adults viewed videos of social and nonsocial touch while undergoing MRI scans. A gPPI analysis of pre-defined regions of interest revealed that autistic adults exhibited increased connectivity between sensory and social brain regions. The strength of some of these connections was positively associated with a higher preference for social touch and greater social responsiveness, suggesting neural compensatory mechanisms that may help autistic adults better understand the meaning of touch. At the level of large-scale brain networks extracted using ICA, atypical connectivity was predominantly observed between the sensorimotor network and other networks involved in social-emotional processing. Increased connectivity was observed in the sensorimotor network during nonsocial touch, suggesting that embodied simulation, the process by which individuals internally simulate touch experience of others in this context, may be more engaged when observing human-object interactions than during human-to-human touch in autism. This study reveals atypical context-dependent modulation of functional brain architecture associated with autism during touch observation, suggesting that challenges in recognizing and using affective touch in social interactions may be associated with altered brain connectivity. Neural compensatory mechanisms in autistic individuals who enjoy social touch and show higher social responsiveness may function as adaptive social responses.

Currently, the DDR in A. baumannii is not well understood and the regulation of genes encoding multiple copies of DNA Pol V is not fully characterized. Through genome wide mutagenesis, we have identified a novel TetR-like family regulator of genes that encode DNA Pol V, which we have named Error-prone polymerase regulator, EppR.

Discrete genomic changes and modulation in gene expression occur in Burkholderia pseudomallei undergoing adaptation. Alternatively, adapted colony morphotype variants of species belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) lose a complete replicon (the pC3 virulence megaplasmid), which affects their production of virulence factors. We report that variants arising in Burkholderia ambifaria clinical isolates - with affected phenotypes - have retained their pC3, suggesting that another phase variation mechanism can take place in this Bcc species. Proteomic and phenotypic characterisation showed that morphotype variants of B. ambifaria strains CEP0996 (pC3-null) and HSJ1 (pC3-positive) share similarities in phenotypes controlled by the Cep quorum sensing system. Thus, we determined the role of quorum sensing in B. ambifaria HSJ1 phase variation and confirmed that the main quorum sensing system Cep is important for the emergence of variants. As DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic factors involved in bacterial phase variation that regulates some virulence factors of the Bcc species Burkholderia cenocepacia, we hypothesized that B. ambifaria HSJ1 phase variation could also be regulated by adenosine DNA methylation. By deleting the three putative adenosine DNA methyltransferases, we found that an orphan type II DNA methyltransferase prevents the emergence of phase variants. This is the first study to report quorum sensing and adenosine DNA methylation as two antagonistic systems independently controlling phase variation.\n\nImportanceSome Burkholderia species are pathogenic to plants, animals, or humans.

Our goal was to target an orphan G-Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) on platelets belonging to the olfactory receptor family as a new antithrombotic strategy. Methods: Using an engineered reporter cell line expressing Olfactory Receptor 2L13 (OR2L13) that was recently identified as an orphan GPCR to limit platelet reactivity, we performed a high-throughput screen (HST) of non-odorant bioactive compounds with counter-screen validation, followed by studies to determine changes in platelet function in healthy subjects and in patients with coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. Phospho-proteomics identified key signal transduction pathways, and a variety of ex vivo assays and in vivo functional studies examined the impact of an identified non-odorant compound on platelet signaling, platelet biomechanics, and thrombosis. Results: We identified 6 ligands specific for OR2L13 that function as receptor agonists, leading to the suppression of platelet aggregation and -granule exocytosis via P2Y12, PAR1, Thromboxane Receptor (TxR) and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptors, suggesting involvement of common downstream mediator. The lead OR2L13 agonist identified phosphorylates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and depolymerizes the platelet filamentous actin cytoskeleton which was further confirmed in a clot retraction assay (CCF0054500 clot area 70.6 vs. vehicle clot area 5.2, P<0.0001).

Upon the workshops conclusion, its effectiveness was assessed through surveys and standardized evaluation scales.\n\nTwenty-nine students addressed the critical challenge of metagenomics metadata standardization. Workshops resources have equipped students with foundational knowledge in metagenomics and Python programming, empowering them to curate metadata from 379 amplicon-based and shotgun sequencing projects of the human skin microbiome. The collaborative endeavors of these students will ensure the construction of a curated metadata collection.\n\nThe Data Hunters Workshop established a reusable model for similar educational aims, facilitating metagenomics and bioinformatics teaching and metadata curation.

Native membranes typically comprise different types of lipids, biomolecules and proteins assembled around a lipid bilayer structure. This complexity can render investigations challenging, with many studies relying on model membranes such as artificial vesicles and supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). The purpose of a model system is to capture the desired dominant features of the native context while remaining uniquely defined and simpler. Here, we search for a minimal lipid-only model system of the Escherichia coli inner membrane. We aim to retain the main lipidomic components in their native ratio while mimicking the membrane thermal and mechanical properties. We design a collection of candidate model systems reflecting the main aspects of the known native lipidomic composition and narrow down our selection based on the systems phase transition temperature. We further test our candidate model systems by independently measuring their elastic properties. We identify 3 ternary model systems able to form stable bilayers that closely mimic E. colis inner membrane lipid composition and mechanical properties. These model systems are made of commercially available synthetic 16:0-18:1 phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 16:0-18:1 phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and 16:0-18:1 Cardiolipin (CL).

Being a Gram-negative bacterium, E. Coli is characterized by a thin cell wall that separates two phospholipid membranes: the inner and outer membranes.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular pathology induced by the expression of R405W mutant desmin in murine skeletal muscle tissue.\n\nMethodsA comprehensive characterization of the skeletal muscle pathology in hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice was performed, employing grip strength, blood acylcarnitine and amino acid, histological, ultrastructural, immunofluorescence, immunoblot, ribosomal stalling, RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses.\n\nResultsBoth hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice showed classical myopathological features of a myofibrillar myopathy with desmin-positive protein aggregation, degenerative changes of the myofibrillar apparatus, increased autophagic build-up, and mitochondrial alterations. Muscle weakness and increased blood concentrations of acylcarnitines and amino acids were only present in homozygous animals. During its translation, mutant desmin does not induce terminal ribosomal stalling. Analyses of RNA sequencing and proteomic data from soleus muscle of 3-month-old mice depicted 59 up- and 2 down-regulated mRNAs and 101 up- and 18 down-regulated proteins that were shared between the heterozygous and homozygous genotypes in the respective omics datasets compared to the wild-type genotype. Combined analysis of the omics data demonstrated 187 significantly dysregulated candidates distributed across four groups of regulation. A down-regulation on the mRNA and protein levels was observed for a multitude of mitochondrial proteins including essential proton gradient-dependent carriers. Up-regulation on both omics levels was present for the transcription factor Mlf1, which is a binding partner of protein quality control related Dnajb6. Down-regulated on mRNA but up-regulated on the protein level was the sarcomeric lesion marker Xirp2 (xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 2), whereas Ces2c (acylcarnitine hydrolase) was regulated in the opposite way.\n\nConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that the expression of mutant desmin results in a myofibrillar myopathy in hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice. Combined morphological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses helped to decipher the complex pattern of early pathological changes induced by the expression of mutant desmin.

It is responsible for both the production of T cells and the prevention of their autoimmunity. It comprises two types of tissue: the cortex, where nascent T cells (thymocytes) are generated; and the medulla, embedded within the cortex, where autoreactive thymocytes are eliminated through negative selection. In mice, the medulla exhibits a complex, convoluted morphology, which has raised the question of whether its form impacts its function. Intriguingly, experiments also reveal a reverse dependency: the interactions between medullary stroma and thymocytes shape the medullary structure. However, understanding the underlying mechanisms of medulla morphogenesis emerging from these interactions remains elusive. Here, we present a conceptual theoretical model which shows that central, experimentally verified signaling pathways suffice to shape the convoluted medullary structure. The mathematical analysis of the model explains the observed effects of chemotaxis on thymocyte localization, as well as the reported morphological changes resulting from the modulation of thymocyte production. Our findings reveal that the established cross-talk between medulla growth and negative selection of thymocytes not only regulates medullary volume but also orchestrates the morphology of the thymus medulla. This mechanism of structure formation robustly organizes the medulla in a way that accelerates thymocyte negative selection by improving their chemotactic migration into the medulla. Thereby, we identify a feedback between the function of the thymus medulla and its form.

Each molecular subtypes displays distinct features resembling those of human HBs. However, research has been hampered by a paucity of established cell lines of any species.\n\nMethodsWe show here that immortalized cell lines can be routinely established from murine HBs that over-express B+Y and B+Y+N.

Intracellular trafficking regulates the availability of receptors on the cell surface to bind ligands, which regulate activation, and the movement of activated receptors between the surface and intracellular pools, where they can initiate different signaling pathways. Using experimental data and computational modeling, we recently demonstrated and quantified the differential trafficking of three VEGF receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and coreceptor Neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Here, we expand that approach to quantify how the binding of different VEGF ligands alters the trafficking of these VEGF receptors and demonstrate the consequences of receptor localization and ligand binding on the localization and dynamics of signal initiation complexes. We include simulations of four different splice isoforms of VEGF-A and PLGF, each of which binds to different combinations of the VEGF receptors, and we use new experimental data for two of these ligands to parameterize and validate our model. We show that VEGFR2 trafficking is altered in response to ligand binding, but that trafficking of VEGFR1 is not; we also show that the altered trafficking can be explained by a single mechanistic process, increased internalization of the VEGFR2 receptor when bound to ligand; other processes are unaffected. We further show that even though the canonical view of receptor tyrosine kinases is of activation on the cell surface, most of the ligand-receptor complexes for both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are intracellular. We also explore the competition between the receptors for ligand binding, the so-called  decoy effect, and show that while in vitro on the cell surface minimal such effect would be observed, inside the cell the effect can be substantial and may influence signaling. We term this location dependence the  reservoir effect as the size of the local ligand reservoir (large outside the cell, small inside the cell) plays an integral role in the receptor-receptor competition.

Due to the widespread pathological nature of AD, many brain regions are affected by amyloid beta plaques including regions important for vision such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus which is critical for relaying signals from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Using a wide range of techniques including electrophysiological approaches, in vivo and ex vivo imaging methods, and immunohistochemistry in a mouse model with progressing amyloidosis (5xFAD), the goal of this study was to determine whether AD-like pathology disrupts neuronal and synaptic structure and function in the visual system. In vivo electroretinogram recordings revealed photoreceptor dysfunction in the 6- and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice, while optical coherence tomography indicated no changes in retinal thickness. In the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the rodent homolog of the primate LGN, we identified decreased densities of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals and fewer thalamocortical (TC) neuron cell bodies. No detectable deficits in excitatory synaptic function or TC neuron dendritic structure were seen in the dLGN, and reflexive visual behavior was also found to be normal in the 5xFAD mice. These results indicate relatively modest amyloid-triggered dysfunction in these stages of the visual system suggesting that amyloid beta plaque formation may play only a small role in the visual system dysfunction seen in AD patients.

Our group has recently identified the polyphenol carnosic acid (CA), as a potent regulator of mast cell activation in the context of allergic inflammation. Due to the key role IL-33 plays in the enhancement of allergies and other mast cell-associated diseases, we sought to determine the inhibitory potential of CA in a model of IL-33-mediated mast cell activation. Bone marrow-derived mast cells were stimulated with IL-33 under potentiation of SCF and treated with CA in the presence or absence of an allergen co-stimulation. Here, it was determined that treatment with CA led to a reduction in early ROS production, which translated into a significant impairment in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-13, TNF and chemokines CCL1, CCL2 and CCL3. Surprisingly however, it was determined that CA treatment increased signaling through Akt and NF{kappa}B protein phosphorylation, leading to increased gene expression of IL6, IL13, and CCL3 as well as increased intracellular concentrations of IL-6 and CCL3. Taken together, our data suggests treatment with CA impairs the release mechanisms of pro-inflammatory mediators following IL-33 activation, warranting further investigation into the versatile biological activity of CA toward advance our understanding of CA as a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.29.615703", "title": "Thrifty superorganism phenotypes emerge as a plastic response to extreme environments in the Hercules ant", "authors": "Plante, E.; Abouheif, E.; Lessard, J.-P.", "author_corresponding": "Ehab Abouheif", "author_corresponding_institution": "McGill University", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "ecology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.09.29.615703.source.xml", "abstract": "High-altitude human populations are a classic example of adaptation to extremely stressful environments through thrifty phenotypes, where individuals adapt plastically by reducing specific organ size, like limbs, while maintaining overall size. However, it remains unknown, whether other organisms exhibit thrifty phenotypes, and which external factors may shape them. Here, we address these questions in ant colonies, considered superorganisms. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis applied to eusocial organisms predicts that colonies experiencing food shortage should reduce investment in costly individuals. In polymorphic colonies, the largest workers known as majors are costly to produce and should therefore be less abundant in colonies experiencing food shortage. Alternatively, the starvation resistance hypothesis posits that colonies in stressful environments should maintain larger colonies, which provide a nutritional buffer in times of food shortage. We show that the proportion of majors in colonies of the Hercules ant, Camponotus herculeanus, decreases plastically with increasing latitude across the temperate and boreal forest biomes of eastern Canada, independently of their average body size, or colony size, resulting in a thrifty superorganism phenotype. Furthermore, we find that the low number of days, annually, when workers can nurse the brood, best predicts these phenotypes.

Their widespread decline coupled with their amenability for asexual propagation propelled them to the forefront of global coral restoration efforts - albeit frequently without much scientific input. To guide these efforts and as a blueprint for similar projects, we conducted a comprehensive population genomic study of Acropora cf. pulchra, a major restoration target species in the Indo-West Pacific. Our results revealed that A. cf. pulchra populations in the Mariana Islands are characterized by large clonal clusters and extremely low levels of genetic diversity. Differentiation among populations followed a significant isolation-by-distance pattern and delineated two distinct metapopulations on Guam. Our investigation identified critical population genetic parameters, necessitating targeted management strategies, and provides actionable guidelines for effective conservation efforts. For management and conservation, two populations emerged as pivotal connectivity hubs with elevated genetic diversity. For restoration, we show that A. cf. pulchra populations demonstrated a suitability for extensive asexual propagation and provide guidelines how to best apply that. To preserve and augment genetic diversity, strategies to mitigate inbreeding are crucial until sexual reproduction can be fully integrated into restoration protocols. Critical sites for restoration include local connectivity hubs, fringing lagoons that connect metapopulations, and back reefs around a particularly isolated population. These findings offer crucial insights into the genetic landscape of a keystone coral species and provide actionable recommendations for coral conservation and restoration.

Studies using animal models have shown that binge eating animals consume food in quantities that surpass physiological necessity, and that the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior overlap with those involved in habit formation. Habitual behaviors are thought to be automatic responses acquired through extended behavioral training and are dependent on the context in which they were learned. Therefore, this study hypothesized that binge eating has a context-dependent component. We investigated whether the excessive palatable sugar intake observed in an animal model of binge eating is triggered by an associated context as a learned behavior. To test this, mice were trained to develop binge-like sugar consumption in a specific context. During the test phase, we reduced the animals hedonic needs for sugar solution by providing a two-hour satiety period. Sugar solution was then presented in both the training context and a novel context. The results showed that in the training context, the mice continued to consume sugar solution at levels similar to those observed at the onset of the satiation. In contrast, this context-induced sugar consumption was not observed in the novel context. These findings suggest that, like habitual behaviors, binge eating is induced under in the context-dependent manner and insensitive to the consequence of the behavior.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.29.615298", "title": "Iterative sacrificial 3D printing and polymer casting to create complex vascular grafts and multi-compartment bioartificial organs", "authors": "Brassard, J.

We propose a method by which cell-laden hydrogels are molded around ready-made polymeric vascular templates created via 3D printing to create human-scale artificial organs with internal vasculature. Bioartificial pancreas systems with up to 9 internal flow channels were obtained via sacrificial carbohydrate glass 3D printing, porogen-loaded polycarbonate polyurethane dip-coating, followed by casting cell-laden hydrogels around the vascular templates. We optimized porogen size and concentration to maximise the porosity of our scaffolds without compromising mechanical properties, resulting in suture retention strength and compliance respectively matching commercial vascular grafts and native vessels.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biochemical process where cells lose epithelial features and gain mesenchymal traits, is linked to chemoresistance and metastasis. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a novel label-free electrokinetic technique, offers promise in detecting cell phenotype changes. In this study, we employed EIS to detect EMT in prostate cancer cells (PCCs). PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells were treated with an EMT induction media for five days. EIS characterization revealed unique impedance spectra correlating with metastatic potential, distinguishing DU145 EMT+ and EMT-cells, and LNCaP EMT+ and EMT-cells (in combination with dielectrophoresis), with comparisons made to epithelial and mesenchymal controls. These changes were supported by shifts in electrical signatures, morphological, and protein expression, including downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin. No phenotype change was observed in PC3 cells, which maintained a mesenchymal phenotype. EMT+ cells were also distinguishable from mixtures of EMT+ and EMT-cells. This study demonstrates key advancements: application of EIS and dielectrophoresis for label-free EMT detection in PCCs, characterization of cell electrical signature after EMT, and EIS sensitivity to EMT transitions.

It is challenging to use this information for analysis of distribution and trends. The lack of a protocol leads to bias in observations and therefore data are not representative. The bias is a consequence of unequal detection probabilities, caused by different preferences and habits of citizen scientists.\n\nMETHODSWe propose to incorporate characteristics of these excursions in analyses of data collected by citizen scientists to improve estimates of the probability that a species is not detected and reported, even though it does occur. By limiting these models to areas that are known to be occupied, detection can be modeled separately without considering variation in occupancy. We apply this idea to 150 common species in the Southwest Delta of The Netherlands, and illustrate the data selection, the modeling process and the results using four species.\n\nRESULTSThe strongest features to predict detection are the number of species during a visit (list length), earlier observations of the target species by the same observer, and the day of year. We compare three approaches to predict the total non-detection probability that takes all visits to an area into account. Predictions based on only the number of visits were outperformed by predictions that also take the list length into account. Our predictions based on all features combined consistently beat both other approaches, across all 10 species groups that were compared.\n\nDISCUSSIONWe thus show that explicitly modelling the characteristics of all visits to an occupied area results in estimation of non-detection probabilities, while providing insight into the causes of detection and reporting bias. Furthermore, predictions of our model provide a basis for quantifying the sampling effort in each area, which is a promising first step to correct bias in citizen science data when aiming to map a species distribution.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615750", "title": "Unlocking the Potential of Low Quality Total RNA-seq Data: A Stepwise Mapping Approach for Improved Quantitative Analyses", "authors": "Lee, J.; Gim, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jungsoo Gim", "author_corresponding_institution": "Chosun University", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "bioinformatics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.09.30.615750.source.xml", "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing assays face persistent challenges when analyzing low-quality RNAs, often assessed by the RNA integrity number (RIN).

The EH domains contribute towards the establishment of a complex interaction network within clathrin mediated endocytosis by interacting with Asp-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs within intrinsically disordered regions of other endocytic proteins. Using NMR spectroscopy, we investigate the molecular origins of binding from the side of the EH domains as well as from the side of the most intrinsically disordered region of the partner Dab2. In addition to NPF binding, we detect a high level of binding promiscuity leading to significant interaction with non-NPF binding sites. This behavior also leads to interactions between Eps15s EH domains and its own IDR. When all EH domains are expressed in row, as they occur in the wild type full length protein (EH123), EH2 and EH3 tumble together as one entity, while EH1 moves independently. The full EH-domain, comprising EH1, EH2 and EH3, interacts with both Dab2 and Eps15s IDR at the same time with partially competitive binding sites. These data allow insights into competitive network-like interactions determining the early phases of clathrin mediated endocytosis.\n\nSignificance StatementMulti-domain proteins are frequent in many biological processes. Rather than just acting like beads on a string, the EH domains of Eps15 engage in interactions, leading to complex and competitive binding with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) involved in Eps15 itself as well as of other endocytic proteins. Such interactions are important to understand how the early phases of clathrin mediated endocytosis are regulated and offer ideas for how interactions may take place in other multi-domain/IDR protein systems.

Factors such as maternal age, sexually transmitted infections, and genetic abnormalities are notably implicated. Globally, there has been minimal improvement in preterm birth rates, leading to substantial economic losses and underscoring the need for innovative approaches.\n\nObjectiveThis study aims to analyze and detect uterine contractions by applying deep learning techniques to physiological data derived from maternal electrocardiograms (ECGs). Leveraging ECGs, which are easily obtainable from wearable devices, allows for effective and convenient monitoring of uterine contractions outside clinical settings. Since uterine contractions are a critical indicator for assessing the risk of preterm birth, our algorithm has the potential to facilitate early identification of high-risk individuals, thereby contributing to timely interventions and improved maternal-fetal outcomes.\n\nMethodsParticipants meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were recruited from patients admitted to or attending outpatient services at Saintpaulia Misao Ladies Hospital in Gifu, Japan, between December 6, 2023, and July 31, 2024. Our deep learning model was developed using maternal ECG data, uterine contraction waveforms obtained from cardiotocograms (CTGs). The collected data were divided into training and evaluation datasets. The AI-generated uterine contraction waveforms from the developed model were compared with ground truth labels obtained from the fetal monitoring devices. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine at Gifu University and was conducted as a collaborative research effort with nonat Inc. (the lead research institution) and Saintpaulia Misao Ladies Hospital (joint research institution).\n\nResultsFinally, 73 participants took part in this study, and 57 datasets were used for algorithm development and evaluation. Multiple measurements were taken on the same subjects on different days only with their consent. Our analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between the uterine contraction waveforms estimated by the developed model and the ground truth waveforms from CTGs, achieving an average correlation across all evaluation data (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.53).\n\nConclusionThis is the worlds first trial to detect uterine contractions from maternal ECGs using deep learning algorithms. In this study, we successfully developed a deep learning algorithm capable of accurately inferring uterine contraction waveforms from maternal ECGs.

Using 2D gastruloids that recapitulate early aspects of mouse gastrulation in vitro, we have previously shown that WNT3 and NODAL promote distal PS fates on their own, and proximal PS fates in the presence of BMP4. We now detail further the impact of BMP4 on the cell identities produced in gastruloids. Single cell RNA-seq analysis shows that prolonged exposure to BMP4 results in the presence of all the cell types, including primordial germ cells, which normally form from the most proximal part of the pluripotent epiblast. We then show that reducing the duration or intensity of gastruloid exposure to BMP4 can allow the emergence of more distal cell identities, such as paraxial mesoderm, alongside anterior PS derivatives.

In passerine birds, sperm exhibit considerable variation in size, yet the basic sperm phenotype is highly conserved; sperm are filiform, the head is corkscrew-shaped, and the midpiece is elongated and twisted around the flagellum. A significant departure from this typical sperm morphology has been reported in the sister species, the Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and Azores bullfinch (P. murina). Here, we report a second evolutionary shift in passerine sperm phenotype in the nominate subspecies of the red-browed finch (Neochmia temporalis temporalis); sperm are non-filiform, with an ellipsoid head, and an extremely short midpiece restricted to the nuclear-axoneme junction. Additionally, we show that the sperm phenotype of the red-browed finch is similar to the putatively neotenous sperm described in the two bullfinch species. Using whole-genome data, we found no evidence that the unusual sperm phenotype of the red-browed finch is associated with reduced genetic variation or a population bottleneck.

Here, we exhibit the prevalence of both effects in such tasks, and propose that they result from the observers imprecision in their running tally of how many pieces of information they have received. If their approximate counting follows a central tendency -- a typical Bayesian pattern -- then past information is overweighted near the beginning of the sequence, while new numbers are overweighted towards the end of the sequence. Thus both primacy and recency effects are simultaneously predicted by this single mechanism. The model moreover nests exponential discounting as a special case in which the observer has no information about the count. The behavioral data suggests that subjects indeed misestimate the count of observations, with biases similar to those observed in numerosity-estimation tasks.

Thrombocytosis has been well documented in patients affected with IDA. Thus, significance of eRBC parameters in identifying iron deficiency associated thrombocytosis was also examined in this cohort.\n\nMethodsBlood samples were collected in EDTA tubes from consenting donors for analyses of routine haematological and eRBC parameters. Serum samples were isolated for estimation of iron parameters.\n\nResultsIron deficient donors had significantly altered eRBC parameters. Among them, Ret-He with a cut-off of [&ge;]32 pg had high AUC (0.822) and showed relatively high sensitivity & specificity in detecting iron deficiency. Combination of Ret-He with CCI increased sensitivity & specificity to 90.6% and 98.2%, in detection of donors affected with iron restricted erythropoiesis. This cohort had increased platelet counts, which showed significant association with Ret-He ({beta}= -0.373), RBC-He ({beta}= -0.384), CCI ({beta}= 0.384), Hypo-He ({beta}=0.494) and Micro-R ({beta}= 0.299). Elevated platelet counts also showed significant correlations with these eRBC parameters, which was absent in iron replete donors.\n\nConclusionseRBC parameters are sensitive indicators of non-anaemic iron deficiency, which may be enhanced by combining them. Their significant association with elevated platelet counts in iron deficient donors, highlights their importance in reflecting iron deficiency associated thrombocytosis.\n\nImpact StatementThe present study discusses utility of eRBC parameters in detecting non-anaemic iron deficiency, in regular voluntary blood donors. Previous reports have investigated the importance of these parameters in identifying IDA in blood donors. The present study is the first one which indicates combining different eRBC parameters such as Ret-He and CCI increases their accuracy of detection. They were also significantly associated with elevated platelet counts in iron deficient donors, which was absent in iron replete individuals.

Phenotyping based on cell mechanics is increasingly recognized as a potential prognostic marker for tumor aggressiveness. We have previously shown that cell and nuclear mechanical properties vary between different grades of gliomas and may be used to differentiate between GBM of different aggressiveness. Here, we find that the levels of lamin proteins can serve as an indicator of GBM aggressiveness. In patient-derived GBM cell lines, we found that cells from different GBM express different lamin levels. Nuclear size correlates positively with the ratio between lamin A and lamin B1 while nuclear stiffness increases with the levels of both lamin A and lamin B1. A simple mechanical model suggests that lamin A and lamin B1 act like springs in series. We also show that cells proliferate faster in GBM cell lines expressing higher lamin A levels. Downregulating lamin A expression in these cells reverse the aggressive phenotype. In contrast with breast cancer cells for which reduced lamin A levels favor cell migration in a confined environment, increased levels of lamin A may facilitate the invasion of more aggressive GBM cell lines in the soft environment of the brain.

Methods: A modified GLM was proposed to explicitly model biological variance and non-biological noise. Employing the Expectation and Maximization (EM) scheme can distinguish biological variance from noise, termed EMSEV (EM for Separating Variances). The performance of EMSEV was evaluated by varying noise levels, dimensions of the design matrix, and covariance structures of the target variables. Results: The deviation between EMSEV outputs and the pre-defined distribution parameters increased with noise level. With a proper initial guess, when the noise magnitude and the variance of the target variables were similar, there were deviations of 3% and 10 to 16% in the estimated mean and covariance of the target variables, respectively, along with a 1.7% deviation in noise estimation. Conclusion: EMSEV appears promising for distinguishing signal variance from noise in biological systems.

However, due to the high computational cost of MD simulations, it is still challenging to explore a wide conformational space. To solve this problem, a variety of accelerated MD schemes have been proposed over the past few decades. The bond-boost method (BBM) is one of such accelerated MD schemes, which expedites escape events from energy basins by adding a bias potential based on changes in bond length. In this paper, we present a new methodology based on the BBM for accelerating the conformational transition of proteins. In our modified BBM, the bias potential is constructed using the dihedral angle and hydrogen bond, which are more suitable variables to monitor the conformational change in proteins. Additionally, we have developed an efficient algorithm compatible with the LAMMPS package. The method is validated with the conformational change of Adenylate kinase (AdK) by comparing the conventional and accelerated MD simulation results. Based on the accelerated MD results, the characteristics of AdK are investigated by monitoring the conformational transition pathways and the behavior of interdomain salt bridges. Moreover, the free energy landscape calculated using umbrella sampling confirms all the states identified by the accelerated MD simulation are the free energy minima and the system makes transitions following the path indicated by the free energy landscape. Our efficient approach is expected to play a key role in investigating transition pathways in a wide range of protein simulations.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615769", "title": "Megakaryocytes build a cage of extracellular matrix that controls their maturation and anchoring to the vascular niche", "authors": "Masson, C.; Scandola, C.; Rinckel, J.-Y.; Proamer, F.; Janus-Bell, E.; Batool, F.; OSMANI, N.; GOETZ, J.

How the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates the balance between being both resident in the bone marrow and in the bloodstream is still unknown in vivo. Here, we address the spatial organisation and functional role of ECM components in the megakaryocyte vascular niche. We reveal that laminin and collagen IV form three-dimensional (3D) cage of ECM connected to the sinusoidal basement membrane that surrounds the individual megakaryocytes. The 3D cages of ECM are controlled by megakaryocytes since megakaryocyte-specific {beta}1/{beta}3 integrin knock-out (Itgb1-/-/Itgb3-/-) is characterised by weakened ECM cages. This is associated with an increased megakaryocyte intravasation and the passage of entire megakaryocytes into the circulation. The inhibition of ECM degradation induces the formation of denser cages, and results in dysplastic megakaryocytes with defective formation of the demarcation membrane system (DMS). Therefore, the 3D ECM cage stabilizes megakaryocytes within their vascular niche to orchestrate their maturation and intravasation capabilities, and underscores the crucial role of a specific ECM microarchitecture in megakaryocyte functions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615241", "title": "Maintenance of neuronal TDP-43 expression requires axonal lysosome transport", "authors": "Ryan, V.

Unconventional biological drugs with complex structures and processing requirements are particularly problematic. Although engineered vector DNA elements can achieve rapid and high-level therapeutic protein production, a high metabolic and protein folding burden is imposed on the host cell. Cellular adaptations to these conditions include differential gene expression profiles that can in turn influence the productivity and quality control of recombinant proteins. In this study, we used quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics analyses to investigate how biological pathways change with antibody titre. Gene and protein expression profiles of CHO pools and clones producing a panel of different monoclonal and bispecific antibodies were analysed during fed-batch production.

Two drugs may show a synergistic effect but may sometimes cause a severe health issue, including lethality. Wet lab studies are often performed to understand such interactions but are limited by cost and time. However, the biochemical data generated can be explored to compute unknown interactions. Here, we developed a computational model named UniGEN-DDI (Unified Graph Embedding Network for Drug-Drug Interaction) for the estimation of interactions between drugs. It is a simple unified network model containing the biochemical information of drug association developed using the compiled data from DrugBank 5.1.0. The feature learning of the drugs was carried out using a combination of GraphSAGE and Node2Vec algorithms, which were found efficient in extracting diverse features. The simple architecture of our model led to a significant reduction in computational time compared to the baselines, while maintaining a high prediction accuracy. The model performed well on the data, which was equally distributed between interacting and non-interacting drugs. As a more challenging evaluation, we performed non-overlapping splitting of the data based on the drug action on different parts of the body, and our model performed well in both interaction estimation and time efficiency.

Specifically, the phantom-based matching resolution approach assumes that scanned phantom PET images are well approximated by a ground truth, noise-free digital phantom convolved with a Gaussian kernel of unknown size. The size of the kernel is then estimated by an exhaustive search on the amount of blurring needed to match the smoothed digital phantom to a particular scanned phantom image. Unfortunately, Hoffman phantom images may not always be readily available, and phantom-based approaches may yield sub-optimal results. We propose a new, computational approach that allows estimation of spatial resolution directly from the PET image itself. We generalized the so-called logarithmic intensity plots method to the 3D case to perform a spatial resolution estimation in both axial and in-plane directions of the PET images. The proposed approach was applied to two different cohorts. The first cohort consisted of [18F]florbetapir amyloid PET images and matching phantoms coming from a Phase II clinical trial and includes different scanner models and/or orientation and grid reconstructions. The second cohort included {beta}-amyloid, FDG and tau PET images from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We obtained in-plane and axial resolution estimators that vary between 3.5 mm and 8.5 mm for both PET and matching phantom images. In both cases, we obtained small across-subject variability in groups of images sharing the same PET scanner model and reconstruction parameters. For human PET images, we also obtained a strong cross-tracer and longitudinal consistency in the spatial resolution estimators.

The Bayesian EstimatioN of CHange (BENCH) framework was specifically designed to circumvent parameter fitting for ill-conditioned models when one is simply interested in interpreting signal changes related to some variable of interest. To understand the biological underpinning of some observed change in MR signal between different conditions, BENCH predicts which model parameter, or combination of parameters, best explains the observed change, without having to invert the model. BENCH has been previously used to identify which biophysical parameters could explain group-wise dMRI signal differences (e.g. patients vs. controls); here, we adapt BENCH to interpret dMRI signal changes related to continuous variables. We investigate how parameters from the dMRI standard model of white matter, with an additional sphere compartment to represent glial cell bodies, relate to tissue microstructure quantified from histology. We validate BENCH using synthetic dMRI data from numerical simulations. We then apply it to ex-vivo macaque brain data with dMRI and microscopy metrics of glial density, axonal density, and axonal dispersion in the same brain. We found that (i) increases in myelin density are primarily associated with an increased intra-axonal volume fraction and (ii) changes in the orientation dispersion derived from myelin microscopy are linked to variations in the orientation dispersion index.

Oddball stimuli embedded in a sequence of regularly repeated visual elements have been shown to drive relatively large deviant responses, a finding that is generally consistent with the theory that cortical circuits implement a form of predictive coding. These results can be confounded by short-term adaptation effects, however, that make interpretation difficult. Here we use various forms of the oddball paradigm to disentangle temporal and ordinal components of the deviant response, showing that it is a complex phenomenon affected by temporal structure, ordinal expectation, and event frequency. Specifically, we use visually evoked potentials to show that deviant responses occur over a large range of time, lead to long-term plasticity in some cases, cannot be explained by a simple adaptation model, scale with predictability, and are modulated by violations of both first and second-order sequential expectations.\n\nSignificance StatementVisual experience and temporal context can modulate evoked responses in mouse V1. There remains disagreement about whether this reflects predictive coding in visual circuits and if visual mismatched negativity, which has important cross-over implications for human clinical work, constitutes evidence supporting this theory or simple neural adaptation. This work strongly supports the former interpretation by demonstrating complex experience-dependent deviant responses that cannot be easily explained by a simple adaptation model.

A novel mutation adds new alleles, hence is tantamount to a change of the game by the addition of new actions.

To address this, we compare evolutionary signatures extracted from CG methylomes and genomes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon. While methylation variants (SMPs) are less effective than genetic variants (SNPs) for identifying population differentiation in A. thaliana, they can classify phenotypically divergent B. distachyon subgroups that are otherwise genetically identical. The site frequency spectra generated using methylation sites from varied genomic locations and evolutionary conservation exhibit similar shapes indicating minimal noise when jointly analyzing all CG sites. Nucleotide diversity is three orders of magnitude higher for methylation variants compared to genetic variants in both species, driven by the higher epimutation rate. Correlations between SNPs and SMPs in nucleotide diversity and allele frequencies at gene exons are weak or absent in A. thaliana, possibly because the two sources of variation reflect evolutionary forces acting at different timescales. Linkage disequilibrium quickly decays within 250bp for methylation variants in both plant species suggesting their versatility for evolutionary analyses.

A key advantage of these methods is the potential to detect association signals caused by allelic heterogeneity -- when multiple causal variants modulate a phenotype -- in both coding and noncoding regions. Recent scalable methods for inferring locus-specific genealogical trees along the genome, or representations thereof, have made substantial progress towards this goal; however, the problem of testing these trees for association with phenotypes has remained unsolved due to the growth in the number of clades with increasing sample size. To address this issue, we introduce several practical improvements to the kalis ancestry inference engine, including a general optimal checkpointing algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models, thereby enabling efficient genome-wide analyses. We then propose  LOCATER, a powerful new procedure based on the recently proposed Stable Distillation framework, to test local tree representations for trait association. Although LOCATER is demonstrated here in conjunction with kalis, it may be used for testing output from any ancestry inference engine, regardless of whether such engines return discrete tree structures, relatedness matrices, or some combination of the two at each locus. Using simulated quantitative phenotypes, our results indicate that LOCATER achieves substantial power gains over traditional single marker testing and window-based testing in cases of allelic heterogeneity, while also improving causal region localization relative to single marker tests. These findings suggest that genealogy based association testing will be a fruitful approach for gene discovery, especially for signals driven by multiple ultra-rare variants.\n\nAuthor summaryFor a given set of individuals and at particular location in the genome, there is an underlying genealogical tree relating those individuals. Due to recombination, this tree is not static but rather varies along the genome. For decades investigators have sought to learn and use these trees to identify regions of the genome that impact human traits and disease. In other words, to find trait-associated trees where different clusters of relatives have, for example, high blood pressure. However, since these trees can be so enormous, it is difficult computationally to build them from DNA samples and difficult statistically to find trees with disease clusters: since each tree encodes so many possible clusters, it becomes hard to distinguish signal from noise. Here, we develop a new statistical method, LOCATER, to efficiently aggregate signals across disease clusters within each tree and thereby detect trait-associated trees. LOCATER can work with any ancestry inference method. We show LOCATER is better at detecting these trees than existing methods. We also introduce a suite of broadly applicable algorithms that make our ancestry inference software, kalis, and LOCATER computationally efficient.

While prior studies have characterized viral diversity due to single nucleotide polymorphisms, little is known about POWV recombination, defective RNAs (D-RNAs), and functional structural variants (SVs). Understanding POWV recombination in its natural vector can provide important insights into its replication and evolution. Thus, we analyzed POWV sequence data from 51 ticks collected from the Northeast United States to characterize deletion expression levels and patterns in naturally infected ticks, and we compared these results to single-passage isolates. We found that deletions were common in POWV RNA from ticks and that several areas of the genome were enriched for recombination junctions. Deletions were often associated with areas of microhomology. While most deletions were sample-specific, two major deletion archetypes were observed across multiple tick samples. The first consisted of small 19-50 base deletions in the methyltransferase domain of the ns5 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene, resulting in a mixture of putative SVs and D-RNAs. The second consisted of approximately 1600 base deletions spanning the ns2a-ns3 genes, resulting in putative D-RNAs with abrogated viral protease function.

This structural flexibility enables a deeper understanding of how individuals learn and adapt in real-world scenarios. The DSL framework reconstructs the most likely sequence of agent structures--sourced from a pool of learning rules and environment models--based on observed behaviors. The method provides insights into how an agents internal structure model evolves as it transitions between different structures throughout the learning process. We applied our framework to study rat behavior in a maze task. Our results demonstrate that rats progressively refine their mental map of the maze, evolving from a suboptimal representation associated with repetitive errors to an optimal one that guides efficient navigation. Concurrently, their learning rules transition from heuristic-based to more rational approaches. These findings underscore the importance of both credit assignment and representation learning in complex behaviors.

However, IMS experiments tend to yield large datasets, routinely recording over 200,000 ion intensity values per mass spectrum and more than 100,000 pixels, i.e., spectra, per dataset. Traditionally, IMS data size challenges have been addressed by feature selection or extraction, such as by peak picking and peak integration. Selective data reduction techniques such as peak picking only retain certain parts of a mass spectrum, and often these describe only medium-to-high-abundance species. Since lower-intensity peaks and, for example, near-isobar species are sometimes missed, selective methods can potentially bias downstream analysis towards a subset of species in the data rather than considering all species measured.\n\nResultsWe present an alternative to selective data reduction of IMS data that achieves similar data size reduction while better conserving the ion intensity profiles across all recorded m/z -bins, thereby preserving full spectrum information. Our method utilizes a low-rank matrix completion model combined with a randomized sparse-format-aware algorithm to approximate IMS datasets. This representation offers reduced dimensionality and a data footprint comparable to peak picking, but also retains complete spectral profiles, enabling comprehensive analysis and compression.

Using a combination of bioinformatic and entropy maximization tools, we model an ensemble of structures representing the conformational space of CIIIs disordered QCR6  hinge within the yeast CIII2CIV2 supercomplex. Molecular and Brownian Dynamics simulations of the entire supercomplex reveal a mechanism for electrostatic coupling between these negatively charged hinge conformations, and binding and directional diffusion of the redox proteins on the mitochondrial membrane, which is simulated over the millisecond timescale. Anionic lipids reinforce this conformationally-coupled recognition of the supercomplex by retaining a pool of the redox proteins in the vicinity of the membrane when the hinges are of a critical length.

Leukemia cell lines (CLs) have been fundamental to understanding therapeutic responses to pharmacological agents. We generated three DS B-ALL CLs characterized with diverse genomic alterations, including IGH::CRLF2 rearrangement (BCR::ABL1 like), mutations in FLT3 and TP53, and a novel ERG::CEBPD rearrangement. DS CLs had diminished proliferation, metabolism, and mitochondrial function when compared to non-DS (NDS) CLs and interestingly, these findings were similar to NDS Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) B-ALL CLs. Based on similar mitochondrial defects and prior preclinical data using Venetoclax for Ph-like B-ALL, we hypothesized that Venetoclax would be effective in DS. Intriguingly, Venetoclax was more effective in DS when compared to both NDS and Ph-like CLs. Efficacy was observed in DS patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and diagnostic/relapsed patient samples treated with Venetoclax, which synergized with Trametinib and Vincristine. Mass spectrometry-based multiomics analyses in DS and NDS B-ALL patient samples revealed an enriched metabolite profile in DS, particularly in the hubs of glucose metabolism and polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylinositols. Transcriptome analyses in DS B-ALL patients (n=249) supported enhanced glucose and fatty acid metabolism; along with a reliance on BCL2 family members for apoptosis resistance. Venetoclax synergized with inhibition of glucose metabolism in DS B-ALL CLs. In summary, we have generated novel tools for studying DS B-ALL and identify altered metabolism in DS that responds to Venetoclax.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.614674", "title": "Identification and characterization of tertiary lymphoid structures in brain metastases", "authors": "Mughal, S.

We aimed to identify whether acid excretion capacity is disturbed in calcium oxalate (CaOx) or calcium phosphate (CaP) stone formers.\n\nMethodUrinary, serum, clinical, and anthropomorphic baseline data were obtained from the Swiss Kidney Stone Cohort, a prospective, longitudinal, and multi-centric observational study. We included in this study 193 non-stone formers (NSF, confirmed by negative CT scan), and 309 CaOx and 28 CaP stone formers. Titratable acids, net acid excretion (NAE), NAE capacity (NAEC) and acid-base (AB) score were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the potential associations of various acid-base variables with the occurrence of CaOx kidney stones.\n\nResultsCaOx stone formers showed a disturbed capacity to excrete acids in comparison to NSF (NAEC NSF = 3.49{+/-}12.6 mmol/24h; CaOx = -1.06{+/-}13.10; CaP = 0.97{+/-}14.70 and AB score NSF = 20.5{+/-}6.36 mmol/24h; CaOx = 17.9{+/-} 6.53; CaP = 18.8{+/-}6.10). The correlation between urine calcium and urine pH was altered in CaOx stone formers and between urine calcium and NAE was stronger in CaP stone formers. Logistic models showed that urinary ammonium was negatively associated with CaOx stone formation (unadjusted model, odds ratio 0.43[0.32-0.58], p< 0.001 for CaOx). Urine calcium was positively associated with CaOx kidney stones (2.85 [2.11-3.92], p<0.001). Similar results were obtained after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Replacing urine ammonium, pH, and phosphate with NAEC or ammonium and pH with AB score in our logistic regression models showed that NAEC and AB score are strongly associated with CaOx kidney stone formation.\n\nConclusionAmmonium excretion, NAEC and AB score are associated with the occurrence of CaOx kidney stones suggesting a potential role of proximal tubule dysfunction in their formation.

CPK28 regulates immune homeostasis, stress responses, and growth in multiple angiosperms including tomato, rice, cotton, and Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter, Arabidopsis). In Arabidopsis, CPK28 phosphorylates and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligases PLANT U-BOX 25 (PUB25) and PUB26 that target the major immune signaling protein BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1), resulting in its turnover. The CPK28-PUB25/26-BIK1 regulatory module maintains precise levels of BIK1 in the cell and is thought to optimize immune responses. Separated from angiosperms by 450M years of evolution, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (hereafter, Marchantia) has emerged as a model system to study the evolution of signaling modules across land plants. Here, we demonstrate that the function of CPK28 is conserved in Marchantia. MpCPK28 displays Ca2+-dependent protein kinase activity and is inhibited by calmodulin in vitro. Over-expression of MpCPK28 results in pronounced developmental phenotypes and decreased chitin-induced oxidative burst, and MpCPK28 can functionally complement the mutant phenotypes of the Arabidopsis cpk28-1 mutant. MpCPK28 associates with and phosphorylates multiple residues on Marchantia AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE 1 (PBS1)-like (PBL)-a (MpPBLa), a functional ortholog of AtBIK1, as well as MpPUB20e (a putative ortholog of AtPUB25/26).

Considerable debate remains over how mesolimbic dopamine responds to aversion and in the context of aversive conditioning. Inconsistencies may arise from the use of aversive stimuli that are transduced along different neural paths relative to reward or the conflation of responses to avoidance and aversion. Here, we made intraoral infusions of sucrose and measured how dopamine and behavioral responses varied to the changing valence of sucrose. Pairing intraoral sucrose with malaise via injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) caused the development of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA), which rendered the typically rewarding taste of sucrose aversive upon subsequent re-exposure. Following CTA formation, intraoral sucrose suppressed the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons (VTADA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine release. This pattern of dopamine signaling after CTA is similar to intraoral infusions of innately aversive quinine and contrasts with that to sucrose when it was novel or not paired with LiCl. Dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioral reactivity to intraoral sucrose and predicted home cage sucrose preference. Further, dopamine responses scaled with the strength of the CTA, which was increased by repeated LiCl pairings and weakened through extinction. Thus, the findings demonstrate differential dopamine encoding of the same taste stimulus according to its valence, which is aligned to distinct behavioral responses.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615806", "title": "Dissociable after-effects of prosocial acts: Effort is costly for others but valued for self", "authors": "Zheng, Y.; Tang, R.", "author_corresponding": "Ya Zheng", "author_corresponding_institution": "Guangzhou University", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.09.30.615806.source.xml", "abstract": "Prosocial behavior requires effort, yet people are often reluctant to exert effort for others benefit.

A non-invasive repetitive mTBI (4 times with a 24-hour interval) was induced in male mice and effect of mTBI was tested on either bregma or pre-bregma position on the head. Periorbital allodynia and spontaneous pain behavior were assessed using von Frey test and grimace score, respectively. Quantitative PCR was used to assess extent of mTBI pathology.

Subsequently, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to examine mRNA and protein expression of glia specific markers and pain associated molecules. The repetitive impacts at the bregma, but not pre-bregma site led to periorbital hypersensitivity, which was correlated with enhanced inflammatory gene expression in multiple brain regions. RNA sequencing revealed mTBI induced distinct transcriptomic profiles in the peripheral TG and central Sp5C and PAG. Using gene set enrichment analysis, positive enrichment of non-neuronal cells in the TG and neuroinflammation in the Sp5C were identified to be essential in the pathogenesis of PTH. In situ assays also revealed that gliosis of satellite glial cells in the TG and astrocytes in the Sp5C were prominent days after injury. Furthermore, immunohistochemical study revealed a close interaction between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes correlating with increased calretinin interneurons in the Sp5C.

Although previous research has investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the species, the level of positive selection on the core genome has yet to be explored. Here, we present the first core genome wide screen of positive selection in the species. A curated dataset of 1003 whole-genome sequences (WGS) was created which represented the global diversity of the species, including all previously identified clades and genetic clusters (GCs). A 100-strain subset, which retained the diversity of the collection, was created by pruning the species-level tree with treemmer; core genes present in all genomes were extracted with Roary and used for positive selection analysis (n = 826). Site-level analysis was performed using PAML with omegaMap for confirmation. Selection along branches separating clades A and B were also investigated using PAML branch-site models and HyPhy. PAML site analysis revealed 17 genes under selection, including six hypothetical genes, most of which were linked to metabolism or transport. Several genes were associated with antimicrobial resistance, such as ileS which confers resistance to mupirocin. cysG and sirC, which catalyse the first two steps in the synthesis of siroheme, were also under selection. Two genes were found to be under selection at the branch-site level by both PAML and HyPhy, of which only one, rhtC, has been functionally characterised.

The kinetics of these signaling molecules are critically modulated by ectonucleotidases, enzymes that convert ATP/ADP to adenosine. Although the expression and function of these enzymes and relevant purinergic receptors in the prostate gland are not well understood, recent reports indicate impaired ATP hydrolysis activity in the aging prostate. Purinergic signaling is known for its role in inflammation, muscle contraction, pain sensation, and cell proliferation in many systems, suggesting its potential importance in normal prostate function and pathological conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. To better understand purine-converting enzymes and purinergic receptors in the prostate, we isolated mouse prostate glands for immunofluorescent staining and microscopy imaging using specific antibodies. Our study identified a differential expression profile of purinergic enzymes and receptors in the prostate: ENTPD1 and P2x1 receptors predominantly in prostate smooth muscle cells, ENTPD2 and NT5E in prostate interstitial cells, and ALPL in prostate epithelial cells. Functionally, in addition to the P2x1-mediated prostate smooth muscle contraction induced by agonist ,{beta}-meATP, we observed an ATP{gamma}S-induced contraction force after P2x1 desensitization. This led to the identification of multiple P2Y receptors in mouse prostate smooth muscle, including P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y11 receptors, which potentially mediate the ATP{gamma}S-induced contraction force.

The mitosome retains ubiquinone and iron sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathways, both of which require protein import that relies on the membrane potential. It was previously proposed that the membrane potential is generated by electrons transferred through an alternative respiratory pathway coupled to a transhydrogenase (TH) that pumps hydrogens out of the mitosome. This pathway relies on an alternative oxidase (AOX) and type II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2), which also exists in plants, some fungi, and several protozoan parasites. To examine this model, we determined the location and function of AOX and NDH2 in C. parvum. Surprisingly, we observed that NDH2 was localized to parasite surface membranes instead of the mitosome. Furthermore, a {Delta}ndh2 knockout (KO) strain was readily obtained, indicating that this protein is not essential for parasite growth. Although, AOX exhibited a mitosome-like staining pattern, we readily obtained an {Delta}aox knockout strain, indicating that AOX is also dispensable for parasite growth. The growth of the {Delta}aox strain was inhibited by the AOX inhibitors SHAM and 8-HQ to the same extent as wild type, indicating that AOX is not the target of these inhibitors in C. parvum.

Genomic analysis and previous studies proposed an alternative respiration pathway involving alternative oxidase (AOX) and type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH2), which are thought to generate the mitosome membrane potential in C. parvum. Additionally, AOX and NDH2 were nominated as potential drug targets, based on their absence in mammalian hosts and sensitivity of parasite growth to known inhibitors of AOX. However, our study demonstrated that NDH2 is not localized in mitosome, AOX non-essential for parasite growth, and knockout lines lacking this enzyme are equally sensitive to AOX inhibitors. These findings indicate that AOX and NDH2 are not ideal candidates for future drug development against cryptosporidiosis and force a re-evaluation for models of how the mitosome generate its membrane potential.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616031", "title": "The MutRS quorum sensing system controls lantibiotic mutacin production in the human pathogen Streptococcus mutans", "authors": "Wyllie, R.

Here, we sequenced the microbiome profiles of samples previously diagnosed by the Labcorp NuSwab(R) test to better understand disruptions to the vaginal microbiome during BV. We show that microbial sequencing can reproduce targeted panel diagnostic results, while also broadly characterizing healthy and BV-associated microbial and metabolic biomarkers.

Since the initial discovery of rocaglates in 1982, various rocaglates and aglains have been synthesized and extensively studied as anticancer and antiviral agents. Here, we report our studies towards the discovery of a novel aglain derivative as an EV-A71 inhibitor and work to decipher its antiviral effect.

The switch from its asexual stage to sexual forms, which is critical for disease transmission, is intricately regulated but signalling pathways involved in this process have remained unknown. In the present study, we report a novel signalling pathway involving Protein Phosphatase PfPPM2, which regulates asexual division of the parasite as well as its conversion to sexual forms. Phosphoproteomics revealed that PfPPM2 may regulate the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in chromatin remodelling and protein translation. One of the key PfPPM2-targets that emerged from these studies was Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), a regulator of heritable gene silencing which contributes to both mitotic proliferation as well as sexual commitment of the parasite. We demonstrate that PfPPM2 promotes sexual conversion by regulating the interaction between HP1, H3K9me3 and chromatin and it achieves this by dephosphorylating S33 of HP1. Regulation of HP1 and Histone H3 by PfPPM2 may also contribute to division. In addition, PfPPM2 also regulates protein synthesis in the parasite by repressing the phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2, which is likely to contribute to parasite division and possibly sexual differentiation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616123", "title": "Group B streptococci lyse endothelial cells to infect the brain in a zebrafish meningitis model", "authors": "Ravishankar, S.; Tuohey, S.

Most studies on how bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier have been performed in vitro using cultured endothelial cells, due to a paucity of animal models. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in neonates and is primarily thought to cross the blood-brain barrier by transcytosis through endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we used optically transparent zebrafish larvae. Timelapse confocal microscopy revealed that GBS forms extracellular microcolonies in brain blood vessels and causes perforation and lysis of blood-brain barrier endothelial cells, which promotes bacterial entry into the brain. Vessels infected with GBS microcolonies were distorted and contained thrombi. Inhibition of clotting worsened brain invasion, suggesting a host-protective role for thrombi. The GBS lysin cylE, implicated in brain invasion in vitro, was found dispensable in vivo. Instead, pro-inflammatory mediators associated with endothelial cell damage and blood-brain barrier breakdown were specifically upregulated in the zebrafish head upon GBS entry into the brain. Therefore, GBS crosses the blood-brain barrier in vivo not by transcytosis, but by endothelial cell lysis and death. Given that we observe the same invasion route for a meningitis-associated strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, our findings suggest that streptococcal infection of brain blood vessels triggers endothelial cell inflammation and lysis, thereby facilitating brain invasion.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.29.615295", "title": "Teicoplanin attenuates RNA virus infection in vitro", "authors": "Espano, E.; Kim, J.; Park, S.

Considering the original indication of TP, we first determined the effects of TP against viruses that cause respiratory tract infections and found that TP inhibits enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses, namely: human and avian influenza viruses; representative coronaviruses including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and SARS-CoV-2; measles virus; human respiratory syncytial virus A2; and enterovirus 71 (EV-71). Representative flaviviruses, Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), were also susceptible to inhibition by TP. In contrast, TP did not attenuate infection of human adenovirus 5, a non-enveloped DNA virus. Addition of TP at the endocytosis stage but not at the attachment/binding stage of PEDV infection reduced PEDV production in vitro, indicating cathepsin inhibition. Meanwhile, addition of TP during either the attachment/binding or the endocytosis stage of ZIKV infection reduced ZIKV particle production in host cells, and in silico modeling suggested that TP has potential binding pockets in the envelope proteins of ZIKV and DENV2.

The full-length galETKM mRNAs 3 end is acquired by exo-nucleolytic processing of the 3-OH ends of the pre-full-length transcripts. However, the gal operon produces an mRNA named galE whose 3 end forms at [~]120 nucleotides from the galE stop codon, thus in the following gene, galT, establishing polarity in gene expression. In this study, we investigated the molecular processes that generate the 3 end of galE mRNA. We discovered that the 3 ends of pre-galE mRNA are produced in the middle of the galT gene as a result of the combination of two separate molecular processes - one previously reported as RDT and the other as unreported RNase E-mediated transcript cleavage. The 3 ends of the pre-galE mRNA are exo-nucleolytically processed to the current 3 end of the galE mRNA. A hairpin structure of 8 base-pair stems and 4 nucleotide-loop formed 5-10 nucleotides upstream of the 3 ends of the galE mRNA blocks the exoribonuclease digestion and renders stability. These findings showed that RNase E produces RNA 3end establishing polarity in gene expression, in contrast to the general role of mRNA degradation.\n\nSignificance statementHere, we show the findings of two molecular mechanisms that generate the pre-galE mRNA 3ends in the gal operon: Rho-dependent termination (RDT) and RNase E-mediated cleavage. These 3 ends are subsequently processed to produce stable galE mRNA with a hairpin structure that prevents exoribonuclease degradation. This mechanism establishes gene expression polarity by generating the 3 end of galE mRNA within the galT gene, contrasting with the usual mRNA degradation role of RNase E.

Therefore, heterotrophic bacteria such as Cupriavidus sp. have been intensively explored for the synthesis of the biodegradable polymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). PHB is also naturally produced by a variety of phototrophic cyanobacteria, which only need sunlight and CO2, thereby allowing a CO2 negative, eco-friendly synthesis of this polymer. However, a major drawback of the use of cyanobacteria is the need of a two-stage production process, since relevant amount of PHB synthesis only occurs after transferring the cultures to conditions of nitrogen starvation, which hinders continuous, large-scale production.\n\nThis study aimed at generating, by means of genetic engineering, a cyanobacterium that continuously produces PHB in large amounts. We choose a genetically amenable filamentous cyanobacterium of the genus Nostoc sp., which is a diazotrophic cyanobacterium, capable of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) fixation but naturally does not produce PHB. We transformed this Nostoc strain with various constructs containing the PHB synthesis operon from Cupriavidus necator H16. In fact, while the transformants initially produced PHB, the PHB-producing strains rapidly lost cell viability. Therefore, we next attempted further optimization of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Finally, we succeeded in stabilized PHB production, whilst simultaneously avoiding decreasing cell viability. In conclusion, the recombinant Nostoc strain constructed in the present work constitutes the first example of a continuous and stable PHB production platform in cyanobacteria, which has been decoupled from nitrogen starvation and, hence, harbours great potential for sustainable, industrial PHB production.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616162", "title": "Trafficking and translation of mRNA in osteocyte dendrites", "authors": "Mazur, C.

Using molecular and imaging approaches, we demonstrated that a subset of mRNAs are enriched in Ocy454 osteocyte-like cell dendrites. To understand how certain mRNAs are directed to dendrites, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay with 7115 oligonucleotide sequences designed from the 3 untranslated regions of eight dendrite-enriched transcripts. We identified localization sequences within some 3UTRs that were both sufficient and necessary for trafficking to osteocyte dendrites, indicating that localization directions are specifically encoded in enriched transcripts. Furthermore, we found that dendrites contain the elements necessary for local translation, and trafficked transcripts were engaged in active translation within dendrites.

To address this need, we have developed a device that facilitates the straightforward mounting of protein crystals for diffraction analysis, and that can be easily manufactured at scale. Inspired by grid-style devices that have been reported in the literature, we have developed an X-ray compatible microfluidic device that can be used to trap protein crystals in an array configuration, while also providing excellent optical transparency, a low X-ray background, and compatibility with the robotic sample handling and environmental controls used at synchrotron macromolecular crystallography beamlines.

These advancements allow us to systematically screen through 200 million human protein pairs and predict 18,316 PPIs with an expected precision of 90%, among which 5,578 are novel predictions. 3D models of these predicted PPIs nearly triple the number of human PPIs with accurate structural information, providing numerous insights into protein function and mechanisms of human diseases.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616059", "title": "Evolutionary origins and innovations sculpting the mammalian PRPS enzyme complex", "authors": "Karki, B.; Macmillan, A.

However, missing knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways to these products hinders their expanded use. Nucleotide sequencing is key in pathway elucidation efforts, and analyses of natural products molecular structures, though seldom discussed explicitly, also play an important role by suggesting hypothetical pathways for testing. Structural analyses are also important in drug discovery, where many molecular representation systems - methods of representing molecular structures in a computer-friendly format - have been developed. Unfortunately, pathway elucidation investigations seldom use these representation systems. This gap is likely because those systems are primarily built to document molecular connectivity and topology, rather than the absolute positions of bonds and atoms in a common reference frame, the latter of which enables chemical structures to be connected with potential underlying biosynthetic steps. Here, we present a unique molecular representation system built around a common reference frame. We tested this system using triterpenoid structures as a case study and explored the systems applications in biosynthesis and structural diversity tasks. The common reference frame system can identify structural regions of high or low variability on the scale of atoms and bonds and enable hierarchical clustering that is closely connected to underlying biosynthesis. Combined with phylogenetic distribution information, the system illuminates distinct sources of structural variability, such as different enzyme families operating in the same pathway. These characteristics outline the potential of common reference frame molecular representation systems to support large-scale pathway elucidation efforts.\n\nSignificance StatementStudying natural products and their biosynthetic pathways aids in identifying, characterizing, and developing new therapeutics, materials, and biotechnologies. Analyzing chemical structures is key to understanding biosynthesis and such analyses enhance pathway elucidation efforts, but few molecular representation systems have been designed with biosynthesis in mind. This study developed a new molecular representation system using a common reference frame, identifying corresponding atoms and bonds across many chemical structures. This system revealed hotspots and dimensions of variation in chemical structures, distinct overall structural groups, and parallels between molecules structural features and underlying biosynthesis.

NW arenaviruses present a glycoprotein (GP) complex on the envelope surface of the virion, which orchestrates host-cell entry and is a key target of the immune response arising from infection and immunization. Each protomer of the trimeric GP is composed of a stable signal peptide (SSP), a GP1 attachment glycoprotein, and a GP2 fusion glycoprotein. To glean insights into the architecture of this key therapeutic target, we determined the crystal structures of NW GP1-GP2 heterodimeric complexes from Junin virus (JUNV) and Machupo virus (MACV). Due to the metastability of the interaction between GP1 and GP2, structural elucidation required the introduction of a disulfide bond at the GP1-GP2 complex interface, but no other stabilizing modifications were required. While the overall assembly of NW GP1-GP2 is conserved with that presented by Old World (OW) arenaviruses, including Lassa virus (LASV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), NW GP1-GP2 complexes are structurally distinct. Indeed, we note that when compared to the OW GP1-GP2 complex, the globular portion of NW GP1 undergoes limited structural alterations upon detachment from its cognate GP2. We further demonstrate that our engineered GP1-GP2 heterodimers are antigenically relevant and recognized by neutralizing antibodies.

The second messenger c-di-GMP regulates a vast array of cellular processes. It is produced by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDE). In A. vinelandii the absence of the AvgReg DGC impairs alginate synthesis while the absence of the PDE MucG increased alginate production. The effect of the different c-di-GMP levels was solely attributed to its essential role in activating the alginate polymerase complex. Here in we investigated the possible role of c-di-GMP in the control of algD transcription, encoding the key enzyme of the alginate biosynthetic pathway. At artificially high or reduced levels of c-di-GMP algD transcription was increased, or almost abrogated, respectively. Therefore, the role of the transcriptional regulator FleQ, one of the best characterized c-di-GMP effectors, was investigated. Alginate production was higher in the DfleQ relative to the wt strain, which agreed with increased algD transcription. These phenotypes were rescued in the DfleQ/fleQ+ complemented strain indicating a FleQ repressing effect. EMSA assay showed that FleQ was able to directly bind to the regulatory region of algD which agreed with the presence of a FleQ binding site overlapping its RpoS-dependent promoter. In A. vinelandii the c-di-GMP is also necessary for expression of alginate C-5 epimerase genes, essential for structuring mature cysts.

Competence mediated bacteriocin expression by S pneumoniae plays a major role in both the establishment and persistence of colonization on this polymicrobial surface. Over 20 distinct bacteriocin loci have been identified in pneumococcal genomes, but only a small number have been characterized phenotypically. In this work, we demonstrate that 3/4th of S. pneumoniae strains contain a highly conserved scb locus that encodes an active lactococcin 972-like bacteriocin called Streptococcin B. In these backgrounds, the scbABC locus is part of the early competence cascade due to a ComE binding site in the promoter region. Streptococcin B producing strains target both members of the population that have failed to activate competence and the 25% of the population that carry a naturally occurring deletion of the ComE binding site and the functional bacteriocin gene. The ComR-type regulator found directly upstream of the scb locus in S. pneumoniae strains can activate scb expression independent of the presence of the ComE binding site but only when stimulated by a peptide that is encoded in the scb locus of S. pseudopneumoniae, a closely related bacterium which also inhabits the human nasopharynx. Given the co-regulation with competence and the phenotypic confirmation of activity, Streptococcin B represents a previously unrecognized fratricide effector that gives producing strains an additional advantage over the naturally occurring deleted strains during colonization.\n\nImportanceStreptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis and otitis media. In order to successfully colonize humans, a pre-requisite to the development of invasive disease, S. pneumoniae must compete with other bacterial inhabitants of the nasal surface for space and nutrients. Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that typically target neighboring bacteria by disruption of the cell surface. S. pnuemoniae encodes a large number of potential bacteriocin, but, for most, their role in competitive interactions has not been defined.

With neurofilament phosphorylation controlling several processes of intermediate filament dynamics, its dysregulation may play a role in ARSACS. Accordingly, we investigated the interaction between CK1 (Casein Kinase 1) and its adaptor proteins FAM83H or FAM83B (FAMily with sequence similarity 83). Here, we report that these target proteins are upregulated in ARSACS patient fibroblasts and co-localize at the sites of intermediate filament bundling. In the Sacs-/- cerebellum, FAM83B compensated for the lack of FAM83H expression, suggesting a cell-type specific activity of CK1 that depends on the relative expression of its adaptor proteins. Further, CK1 inhibition with D4475 or knockdown of the target proteins with the CRISPR system caused neurofilament bundling, a phenotype that was only partially remedied by CK1 activation with SSTC3. Our findings suggest that CK1, FAM83H, and FAM83B contribute to neurofilament bundling in ARSACS; however, the inability of CK1 to resolve neurofilament bundling may reflect an error in a priming phosphorylation event in ARSACS.

During embryonic development, stereotypical epithelial folds emerge from active cellular and molecular processes including cell shape change and differential cell growth. Active thin sheet folding promises to be a powerful design technique in the fields of active solids, soft robotics, and synthetic biology. However, the general principles of active thin sheet folding remain poorly understood. Here we discover a non-canonical cilia-driven thin sheet folding behavior exhibited by basal animal Trichoplax adhaerens. Through volumetric imaging, we found that, despite having no nervous system, T. adhaerens has the remarkable ability to resolve complex body folding states in a non-stereotypical fashion using a carpet of collectively flocking cilia. Cilia-resolved imaging revealed that folds create crease defects in the animals ciliary carpet, which act as information bottlenecks to break collective behavior of cilia. In turn, these bottlenecks enable the disjointed locomotion required for fold removal. These findings point to a two-way coupling mechanism, wherein ciliary activity shapes the animals folding state and vice versa. Our work demonstrates the broad configuration space of non-stereotypical active folding and highlights the power of distributed activity to drive folding and unfolding of a thin multicellular sheet. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for the establishment of a new class of distributed active origami wherein fold lines themselves are dynamic and motile, with implications in engineering of self-folding materials.

To successfully infect, colonize and complete their life cycle, plant pathogens are under constant selective pressures imposed by hosts, leading to genetic adaptation and possibly lineage radiation or speciation. Population and comparative genomics approaches are powerful tools to identify signatures of selection associated with host specialization in pathogen genomes and further allow recapturing population histories. Implementing such approaches, we identified evolutionary signatures of divergent host specialisation in distinct lineages of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, a major disease causing-agent of wheat. Unique collections of Z. tritici were isolated from wild (Aegilops spp.) and domesticated (Triticum aestivum) host grasses in the Middle East and whole-genome sequencing was performed in a selected subset of isolates from each collection. We observed distinct population structure between the two host-diverging pathogens and identified particular genomic features in the Aegilops-infecting isolates that may have shaped their evolutionary history. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that A. cylindrica and A. tauchii -infecting populations of Z. tritici form separate clusters, possibly reflecting incipient speciation driven by divergent host specialization. Using infection experiments, we confirm that Z. tritici isolates collected from Aegilops spp. only infect their respective host species and not T. aestivum. Population genomics analyses and demographic inference furthermore allowed us to detect signatures of recent selection and show that divergence of the wheat-infecting lineage likely coincided with wheat domestication. At last, we confirm a virulence-related role for one candidate effector located in a selective sweep region of the A. cylindrica-infecting pathogen.

A. rugosa exhibited subtle thermal regulation, maintaining relatively stable leaf temperatures across treatments through coordinated adjustments in morphology and gas exchange. Multivariate analyses showed distinct clustering of traits, underlining the integrated nature of plant responses to environmental heterogeneity. Leaf area increased under low-light conditions, while leaf mass area was higher in high-light environments, consistent with shade avoidance syndrome and leaf economics spectrum theory.

Obesity-associated dysregulated lipid metabolism is believed to contribute to the increasing risk of breast cancer. However, the mechanisms linking lipid dysregulation to breast cancer risk and progression remain to be determined. The family of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) evolves to facilitate lipid transport and metabolism. As the predominant isoforms of FABP members expressed in breast tissue, adipose FABP (A-FABP, also known as FABP4) and epithelial FABP (E-FABP, FABP5) have been shown to play critical roles in breast carcinogenesis. In this study, we collected surgical breast tissue samples from 96 women with different subtypes of breast cancer and comprehensively analyzed the expression pattens of FABP4 and FABP5. We found that distinct expression profiles of FABP4 and FABP5 were associated with their unique roles in breast cancer development. FABP4, mainly expressed in breast stroma, especially in adipose tissue, supported neighboring tumor cell lymphvascular invasion through secretion from adipocytes. In contrast, FABP5, primarily expressed in epithelial-derived tumor cells, promoted tumor metastasis by enhancing lipid metabolism. Thus, elevated levels of FABP4 and FABP5 could serve as poor prognostic markers for breast cancer. Inhibiting the activity of FABP4 and/or FABP5 may offer a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.28.615615", "title": "Effect of Futsal-Based Game Training on Performance, Self-Efficacy, Motivation, and Exercise Addiction in Adolescent Non-Athlete Girls", "authors": "Beik, S.; Dehghanizadeh, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jalal Dehghanizadeh", "author_corresponding_institution": "Urmia University", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "physiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.09.28.615615.source.xml", "abstract": "This study examined the effects of futsal-based game training on performance, self-efficacy, motivation, and exercise addiction in adolescent non-athlete girls.

The spatial distribution of mRNA encodes their dynamics, including inherently spatial processes like transport to the nuclear boundary for export. Due to the technical challenges of spatial stochastic processes, tools for studying these subcellular spatial patterns are still limited. Here, we introduce a spatial stochastic model of nuclear mRNA with telegraph transcriptional dynamics. Observations of the model can be concisely described as following a spatial Cox process driven by a stochastically switching partial differential equation (PDE). We derive analytical solutions for spatial and demographic moments and validate them with simulations. We show that the distribution of mRNA counts can be accurately approximated by a Poisson-Beta distribution with tractable parameters, even with complex spatial dynamics.

This study re-analyzed raw data, previously processed using a standard 2D microglial morphology analysis method, using 3D analysis methods.

How these GTPases are appropriately positioned at the opposite poles of a migrating cell is unknown. Here we leverage optogenetics, manipulation of cell mechanics, and mathematical modeling to reveal a surprising long-range mutual activation of the front and back polarity programs that complements their well-known local mutual inhibition. This long-range activation is rooted in two distinct modes of mechanochemical crosstalk. Local Rac-based protrusion stimulates Rho activation at the opposite side of the cell via membrane tension-based activation of mTORC2. Conversely, local Rho-based contraction induces cortical-flow-based remodeling of membrane-to-cortex interactions leading to PIP2 release, PIP3 generation, and Rac activation at the opposite side of the cell. We develop a minimal unifying mechanochemical model of the cell to explain how this long-range mechanical facilitation complements local biochemical inhibition to enable robust global Rho and Rac partitioning. Finally, we validate the importance of this long-range facilitation in the context of chemoattractant-based cell polarization and migration in primary human lymphocytes.

Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of 20 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) samples removed surgically for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, and 10 non-FCD controls, and we developed a new approach, Genotyping Of Transcriptomes Enhanced with Nanopore sequencing (GO-TEN), that combines targeted complementary (c)DNA sequencing with snRNA-seq to perform concurrent single-nucleus genotyping and transcriptional analysis. We find that mosaic pathogenic variants in FCD do not produce a detectable novel cell identity, but instead we observe conserved cell types present both in FCD cases and non-FCD control specimens. Similarly, GO-TEN analysis shows that most pathogenic variant-carrying cells have well-differentiated neuronal or glial identities and are enriched for layer II-III excitatory neurons.

Biological drivers of RHI-related neurodegeneration are not well understood. We interrogated the plasma proteome in aging adults with prior RHI compared to healthy controls (CTL) and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including a subset characterized neuropathologically at autopsy. Methods: Proximity extension assay (Olink Explore) quantified 2,779 plasma proteins in 22 RHI patients (all AD-biomarker negative), 39 biomarker-confirmed AD, and 44 CTL. A subset of participants went to autopsy (N=16) allowing for comparisons of the antemortem plasma proteome between autopsy-confirmed CTE+ (N=7) and CTE- (N=9). Differential abundance and co-expression network analyses identified plasma proteomic signatures of RHI, which were functionally annotated using gene ontology and cell type enrichment analysis. Nonparametric correlations examined plasma proteomic associations with orthogonally-measured plasma biomarkers, global cognitive function, and semi-quantitative ratings of neuropathology burden at autopsy. Results: Differential abundance analysis revealed 434 increased (vs. 6 decreased) proteins in RHI vs. CTL and 193 increased (vs. 14 decreased) in RHI vs. AD. Network analysis identified 9 protein co-expression modules (M1-M9), of which 7 were elevated in RHI compared to AD or CTL. Modules with increased abundance in RHI were enriched for mitochondrial/metabolic, cell division, and immunovascular (e.g., cell adhesion, TNF-signaling) processes. RHI-related modules exhibited strong and selective correlations with immunoassay-based plasma IL-6 in RHI cases, including the M2 TNF-signaling/cell adhesion module which harbored proteins that strongly tracked with cognitive function. RHI-related plasma protein signatures were similar in the subset of participants with autopsy-confirmed CTE, including immune and metabolic modules that positively correlated with medial temporal lobe tau and TDP-43 burden. Conclusions: Molecular pathways in plasma most consistently implicated in RHI were tied to immune response, mitochondrial function, and cell metabolism. RHI-related proteomic signatures tracked with antemortem cognitive severity and postmortem neuropathological burden, providing converging evidence for their role in disease progression.

Breeders must also consider a strong cultural preference for white-grained over brown-grained varieties. Tef is relatively understudied with limited omics resources. Here, we resequenced 220 tef accessions from an Ethiopian diversity collection and also conducted multi-locational phenotyping for 25 agronomic and grain traits. Grain metabolome profiling revealed differential accumulation of fatty acids and flavonoids between white and brown grains. We conducted k-mer and SNP-based genome wide association and uncovered novel marker-trait associations. A significant 70 kb peak for panicle morphology contained the tef orthologue of rice qSH1, a transcription factor regulating inflorescence morphology in cereals. We also observed a previously unknown relationship between grain size, colour, and fatty acids. These traits were highly associated with retrotransposon insertions in homoeologues of TRANSPARENT TESTA 2, a known regulator of grain colour.

We compare the performance of biobalm to similar tools and find a substantial performance increase in succession diagram construction, attractor identification, and attractor control. To illustrate the utility of biobalm, we perform the most comprehensive comparative analysis to date of the succession diagram structure in experimentally-validated Boolean network models of cell processes and random ensembles.

Subsequent immunohistochemical and spatial transcriptomic analyses confirmed that Oxtr expression is enriched in the EPd, revealing distinct molecular organization compared to the neighboring claustrum. Whole brain input-output mapping of EPd Oxtr-positive neurons unveils extensive bidirectional connections to the ventral half of the brain, orchestrating functional circuits regulating olfaction, internal state, and emotion.

This controversy may be due to the heterogeneity in B cell populations, as the balance among the subtypes may impact tumor progression. The immunosuppressive regulatory B cells (Breg) release IL-10 but only represent a minor population. Additionally, tumor-specific antibodies (Ab) also exhibit anti-tumor and pro-tumor function dependent on the Ab isotype. Transcription factor c-Maf has been suggested to contribute to the regulation of IL-10 in Breg, but the role of B cell c-Maf signaling in anti-tumor immunity and regulating antibody responses remain unknown. Methods Conditional B cell c-Maf knockout (KO) and control mice were used to establish a KPC pancreatic cancer model and B16.F10 melanoma model. Tumor progression was evaluated. B cell and T cell phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and cytokine/chemokine profiling. Differentially expressed genes in B cells were examined by using RNA-seq. Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy donors and melanoma patients for B cell phenotyping. Results Compared to B cells from spleen and lymph nodes, B cells in the pancreas exhibited significantly less follicular phenotype and higher IL-10 production in tumor-free mice. c-Maf deficiency resulted in a significant reduction of CD9+ IL-10-producing Breg in the pancreas. PDAC progression resulted in accumulation of circulating B cells with follicular phenotype and less IL-10 production in the pancreas. Notably, B cell c-Maf deficiency delayed PDAC tumor progression and resulted in pro-inflammatory B cells. Further, tumor volume reduction and increased effective T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) were observed in B cell c-Maf KO mice in the B16.F10 melanoma model. RNA-seq analysis of isolated B cells revealed that B cell c-Maf signaling modulates immunoglobulin (Ig)-associated genes and tumor specific antibody production. We furthermore demonstrated c-Maf-positive B cell subsets and increase of IL-10-producing B cells after incubation with IL-4 and CD40L in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients. Conclusion Our study highlights that B cell c-Maf signaling drives tumor progression through the modulation of Breg, inflammatory responses, and tumor-specific Ab responses.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615768", "title": "SIRT4 enhances the cytotoxicity of NK cells toward hepatic stellate cells and reverses liver fibrosis via AMPK\u03b1/P-p53/NKG2DL pathway", "authors": "Zhang, F.; Chen, H.; Da, B.; Cai, Z.; Fang, R.; Zhang, H.; Xie, X.; Zhao, S.; Zhang, M.; Wang, L.; Xu, B.; Zhuge, Y.", "author_corresponding": "Feng Zhang", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "cell biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.09.30.615768.source.xml", "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells exhibit antifibrotic properties in liver fibrosis (LF) by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).

The loss of SIRT4 reduced the cytotoxicity of NK cells against activated HSCs, while its overexpression enhanced this cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, SIRT4 activates AMPK to promote p53 phosphorylation and facilitates its nuclear translocation, which induces the transcription of ULBP1 and ULBP2, members of the NK group 2D Legend (NKG2DL) family of molecules.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rDNA copy number across wild isolates ranges from 90 to 300 copies. Previous studies showed that 35 rDNA copies are sufficient for ribosome biogenesis in this yeast and enable wild-type-like growth in standard laboratory growth conditions. We addressed two major questions concerning rDNA copy number variation in this yeast: (1) What are the fitness consequences of rDNA copy number variation outside and within the natural range in standard laboratory growth conditions? (2) Do these fitness effects change in different growth conditions? We used growth competitions to compare the fitness effects of rDNA copy number variation in otherwise isogenic strains whose rDNA copy number ranged from 35 to 200. In standard growth conditions, we found that fitness gradually increases from 35 rDNA copies until reaching a plateau that spans from 98 to 160 rDNA copies, well within the natural range. However, rDNA copy number-dependent fitness differed across environments. Compared to standard growth conditions, strains with higher rDNA copy numbers showed improved fitness when grown at increased temperature or in glycerol media. Moreover, the gradual fitness increase with increasing rDNA copy number in standard growth conditions gave way to a markedly lower fitness of strains with copy numbers below the natural range in these two stress conditions. These results suggest that selective pressures drive rDNA copy number in this yeast to at least ~100 copies and that a higher number of copies buffers against environmental stress. The similarity of the S. cerevisiae rDNA copy number range to the ranges reported in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and humans points to conserved selective pressures maintaining the range of natural rDNA copy number in these highly diverse species.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616091", "title": "Proton channel inactivation results in loss of chloroplast NDH complex activity", "authors": "Strand, D.

Despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes, little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins. Using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered microscopic, fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins. In contrast to subtidal species, the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections. These features bear a striking resemblance to epidermal microstructures described in other fishes but have distinct morphological differences.

In adult hearts, CPT1b predominates, while CPT1a is co-expressed at lower levels. Pathological stress on the heart induces greater CPT1a expression, and this coincides with a reduction in FAO, yet the role of CPT1a in pathological cardiac remodeling is unknown. Methods: CPT1 isoform expression was assayed in myocardium of human heart failure (HF) patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and a preclinical mouse model of heart failure. To explore the role of CPT1a upregulation in response to pathological stress, mice were subjected to afterload stress via transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery (sham) with cardiac-specific CPT1a knockdown or cardiac-specific, AAV9-mediated CPT1a overexpression (AAV9.cTNTN.Cpt1a), versus empty virus or PBS infusions as controls. MiR370, known to suppress hepatic CPT1a, was assayed and overexpressed to determine if miR370 regulates cardiac CPT1a expression. Results: CPT1a protein was elevated and miR370 reduced in myocardium of male and female NICM patients (204% vs. non-failing unused donor hearts), as well as in failing mouse hearts. AAV mediated miR370 overexpression in mouse hearts suppressed CPT1a expression and attenuated the response of CPT1a to TAC. Preventing CPT1a upregulation in response to TAC in cardiac specific CPT1a knockout mice (csCPT1a ko) exacerbated adverse remodeling, causing severe dysfunction and increased mortality. In contrast, CPT1a overexpression (2.8 fold), attenuated impaired ejection fraction (EF, by 54%) and fractional shortening (FS, 65%) vs. PBS-infused TAC hearts (p<0.05). Delivery of AAV9.cTnT.Cpt1a 4 wks after TAC surgery, led to significant rescue of EF and FS vs. animals receiving empty virus and mitigated the exacerbated dysfunction of csCPT1a ko hearts at 4 wks TAC. RNA-seq and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed a novel function of CPT1a in suppressing hypertrophic, profibrotic and cell death gene programs in both sham and TAC hearts, irrespective of changes in FAO. Conclusions: The effects of CPT1a in the heart extend beyond FAO and include a non-canonical regulation of cardiac gene programs.

We leveraged the unique head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast, ballistic head movements called \"head saccades\". On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade.

To study this, we used the regenerative abilities of the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris, which displays a striking planar pattern of actin fibers at the organism scale. Cellular aggregates formed from dissociated Hydra cells initially lose all actin polarity yet can regenerate a long-range actin pattern within a week. We quantified the appearance of the actin pattern with orientational (nematic) and positional (smectic) order parameters and showed that the actin organization evolves over days from a disordered to an ordered state. During the first hours, the actin meshwork displayed spatial heterogeneity in the orientational order parameter, and ordered domains progressively grew and fused. To better understand the mechanism driving the ordering, we perturbed the tissue physical constraints. We showed that while topology and geometry do not have a direct effect, stretch can strongly bias the orientation of the actin meshwork within hours. Surprisingly, although the Wnt gradient is expected to play an essential role in the actin alignment, the stretch-associated alignment bias happened without a Wnt enrichment. This showed the role of tissue mechanics in the alignment of the actin fibers.

In this study, we explore variations in 3D genome organization within different morphs of the fish Astyanax mexicanus, which includes a river-dwelling surface fish and multiple cave-dwelling morphs. The cave morphs, also known as cavefish, have adapted to the dark and nutrient-scarce cave environments, resulting in distinct metabolic reprogramming that has made them persistently hyperglycemic, resilient to starvation, and prone to fat accumulation. Focusing on metabolic evolution in cavefish, we used liver tissue to conduct genome-wide contact mapping through Hi-C experiments. Comparing the 3D genome architecture of two cave morphs - Pachon and Tinaja - with that of surface fish, we observed significant changes in genome compartmentalization and genomic loops. Some of these changes were common in both Pachon and Tinaja and were classified as cave-specific looping and compartmental switches. By integrating liver Hi-C data with RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and histone ChIP-seq datasets, we gained deeper insight into the relationship between cave-specific 3D genome features and the transcriptional activity at associated loci. Additionally, we identified structural variations in the form of common genomic inversions in Pachon and Tinaja compared to surface fish.

Mutant IDH alters p53 target gene expression through the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an inhibitor of alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG)-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, without preventing p53 accumulation or global genomic binding. Rather, mutant IDH alters chromatin accessibility landscapes that dictate target gene expression, resulting in disabled upregulation of targets that execute tumor suppression. Specifically, mutant IDH disrupts the expression of pro-apoptotic p53 targets that enable p53-dependent tumor regressions, including the death ligand receptor Fas. Pharmacological inhibition of mutant IDH in TP53 wild-type cholangiocarcinoma cells, a tumor type where p53 and IDH mutations are mutually exclusive, potentiates p53 target gene expression and sensitizes cells to Fas ligand and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.

Seventy Wistar rats were used, with an initial acute toxicity study indicating no adverse effects at 5000 mg/kg of the extract. Following toxicity assessment, rats were divided into seven groups, with varying treatments involving Tamarindus indica extract, sodium fluoride, and clomid.

One prominent exception is the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) which is remarkably adapted to withstand prolonged periods (~18 mins) of severe hypoxia, a trait likely driven by its crowded underground lifestyle. Other African mole-rat species are less social or entirely solitary like the Cape mole-rat (Georychus capensis). Here, we asked whether cellular and molecular adaptations to hypoxia map to social traits. We discovered that at the cellular level naked mole-rat fibroblasts survive >30 hours in 1% oxygen, while fibroblasts from terrestrial or non-social mole-rat species (human, mouse and Cape mole-rat) die rapidly under hypoxic conditions. We further show that naked mole-rat mitochondria have evolved morphological, functional and proteomic adaptations crucial for hypoxia resistance, remaining unaffected after long periods of severe hypoxia. We identify the mitochondrial protein Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) as a key player in naked mole-rat hypoxia resilience. Naked mole-rat mitochondria not only express more protective forms of OPA1, but also harbor a structurally unique isoform that likely protects cells from hypoxic damage. We show that evolutionary changes including the functionalization of a unique Opa1 exon support mitochondrial mediated cellular protection. Indeed, knockdown of OPA1 in naked mole-rat cells is sufficient to render them equally susceptible to hypoxia as human cells or cells from non-social African species. Our study demonstrates how molecular evolution drives unique adaptations that enable cells to achieve unprecedented resistance to hypoxic damage. We also show that molecular changes at the level of mitochondria are crucial in conferring hypoxia resistance. Our results thus chart a novel molecular path to understand how robust cellular hypoxia resistance can be achieved.

This study addresses a mechanism by which subendothelial calcifications can increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake into the arterial wall. Methods: Mice overexpressing tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in endothelial cells (eTNAP mice) were used as a model of calcification. Calcification and atherosclerosis were detected by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. The endothelial roughness was characterized by surface metrology. A fluid-structure interaction model was used to calculate wall shear stress (WSS). The uptake of fluorescent LDL was traced in vitro and in vivo. Human arteries were assessed for the prevalence of internal elastic lamina (IEL) calcification. Results: eTNAP mice developed more severe aortic atherosclerosis than controls on the LDL receptor mutant background (p<0.01). Subendothelial calcifications in eTNAP mice were confirmed by micro-CT. An increase in aortic surface area roughness, including the height, volume, and steepness parameters, was observed in eTNAP mice compared to controls (p<0.01). Calcifications affected near-wall hemodynamics, creating pockets of reduced WSS. Endothelial cells cultured on rough surfaces showed increased LDL uptake compared to cells cultured on smooth collagen (p<0.0001). Fluorescent LDLs were traced to subendothelial calcifications in eTNAP mice but not in controls. In humans, IEL calcification was prevalent in older adults and inversely correlated with arterial diameter (p<0.05). Conclusion: Subendothelial calcification is sufficient to perturb near-wall hemodynamics, creating localized areas of reduced WSS, consistent with increased LDL uptake near calcified lesions. Subendothelial calcification may represent an alternative or concurrent mechanism for the initiation of atherosclerosis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615928", "title": "Posterior Parietal Cortex Regulates Intrinsic Neural Timescales and Attentional Processing in Frontal Eye Field", "authors": "Soyuhos, O.; Moore, T.; Chaudhuri, R.; Chen, X.", "author_corresponding": "Xiaomo Chen", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of California, Davis", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.09.30.615928.source.xml", "abstract": "Intrinsic neural timescales characterize the dynamics of endogenous fluctuations in neural activity.

Studies using auditory stimulation consistently observed enhanced evoked responses in tonic versus phasic REM, indicating that the external processing is largely diminished when the eyes move during REM sleep. Whereas exteroceptive processing during sleep is widely studies, investigation on interoception (the processing of bodily signals) during sleep is scarce, and limited to scalp electroencephalographic recordings. Here we studied interoceptive processing in a group of epileptic patients (N = 11) by measuring their heartbeat-related neural activity in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) during phasic and tonic REM sleep and resting wakefulness. Evoked potentials and beta-low gamma spectral power locked to the heartbeat were significantly different in phasic REM compared to tonic REM and wakefulness. Heartbeat-related neural signals exhibited pronounced inter-trial phase synchronization at lower (7-20 Hz) oscillatory activity in all vigilance states, but reduced gamma synchronization at later time points in phasic REM only. Tonic REM and wakefulness did not show significant differences in heartbeat-related activity in the ANT.

Recently we reported an important role of the interaction between DUSP3 and nucleophosmin (NPM) proteins on the regulation of the p53 actions to maintain genomic stability. Since both p53 and NPM often have mutations related to a diverse set of leukemia, this work aimed to evaluate the roles of DUSP3 in the differentiation of two acute myeloid leukemia cell lines not expressing the p53 protein, and the potential correlations with NPM expression. The results demonstrated higher levels of DUSP3 in THP-1 cells compared to HL-60 cells under basal conditions. After PMA-induced differentiation into macrophages, only HL-60 cells presented a dramatic decrease in DUSP3 and NPM proteins expression. The permanent DUSP3 knockdown in THP-1 and HL-60 cells contributed to their differentiation and non-classical polarization after PMA exposure, since the CD14, MHCII, and CD163 markers were decreased whereas the CD11b and CD206 markers were increased. Bioinformatics analyses identified that the negative regulation of the npm1 and dusp3 genes correlates with the reduced survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the strong positive correlation existing between the expression of these two genes is progressively lost according to the degree of maturation of the myeloid cells.

However, integrating data generated from different cohorts with different platforms, such as microarray and RNA-seq, often requires data preprocessing, including normalization. In this study, we empirically evaluate 9 commonly used cross-platform normalization methods. We classify these methods into two main types: joint and separate normalization. Joint methods normalize multiple datasets together, while separate methods normalize each dataset independently. We further divide these methods into unsupervised and supervised approaches depending on whether they use outcomes during their nor-malization process. Examples of joint unsupervised methods include Quantile Nor-malization (QN), while Rank-in serves as an example of a joint supervised method. Training Distribution Matching (TDM) is an example of a separate unsupervised method. We assess each methods ability to cluster samples, predict outcomes, and detect differentially expressed (DE) genes using three real datasets and simulated data. First, our real data analysis suggests that while joint supervised methods can cluster sample groups better than the other two method groups, they double use the outcome data with artificially inflated clustering performance. Their biases are further demonstrated by their inflated type I error in DE analysis and clustering results from simulated data with no DE genes. Second, for outcome prediction, supervised normalization is no longer applicable. Among the unsupervised methods, QN significantly outperforms the other approaches, regardless of whether RNA-seq data is used to predict microarray outcomes or vice versa. Finally, we compare normalization methods on downstream DE analysis using simulation. In addition to direct DE analysis on the combined normalized data using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we also perform a meta-analysis that combines p-values of the DE analysis from each individual data. For DE analysis, the meta-analysis consistently achieves the best balance between controlling type I error and maximizing power for DE gene detection.

Interestingly, the age-related increase in PDE11A4 protein ectopically accumulates in spherical clusters that group together in the brain to form linear filamentous patterns termed ghost axons. The biophysical/physiochemical mechanisms underlying this age-related clustering of PDE11A4 are not yet known.

We found that human and mouse PDE11A4 exhibit several LLPS-promoting sequence features including intrinsically disordered regions, non-covalent pi-pi interactions, and prion-like domains, with multiple bioinformatic tools predicting PDE11A4 undergoes LLPS. Consistent with these predictions, age-related PDE11A4 clusters were non-membrane bound spherical droplets that progressively fuse over time in a concentration-dependent manner. 5 different PDE11 inhibitors (tadalafil, BC11-38, SMQ-02-57, SMQ-03-30 and SMQ-03-20) across 3 scaffolds reversed PDE11A4 LLPS (a.k.a. remixing) in hippocampal HT22 cells, with PDE11A4 droplets reforming (a.k.a. de-mixing) following a 5-hour washout of low but not high concentrations of these compounds.

To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must attach to microtubules from opposing spindle poles, a configuration referred to as biorientation. To avoid chromosome missegregation the conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. While Aurora B localizes to the centromere and inner kinetochore as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without fully disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction and whether additional mechanisms may facilitate tension-dependent phosphorylation of substrate proteins. In this study, we identify the conserved KMN subcomplex Spc105-Kre28 as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora B kinase Ipl1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helical bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 cause defective mitotic error correction, closely resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. In biochemical experiments we show that Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with the KMN network via the Spc105/Kre28 subcomplex and that binding is inhibited by Ipl1 autophosphorylation. The phenotype of the kre28 mutant cells can be efficiently suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1, demonstrating the importance of Ipl1 docking to the outer kinetochore.

Factors controlling the interactions of the genome with the NL have largely remained elusive. Here, we identified DNA topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2B) as a regulator of these interactions. TOP2B binds predominantly to inter-LAD (iLAD) chromatin and its depletion results in a partial loss of genomic partitioning between LADs and iLADs, suggesting that its activity might protect specific iLADs from interacting with the NL. TOP2B depletion affects LAD interactions with lamin B receptor (LBR)more than with lamins. LBR depletion phenocopies the effects of TOP2B depletion, despite the different positioning of the two proteins in the genome.

We describe Miniature, a tool to automatically generate informative image thumbnails from multiplexed tissue images in an unsupervised and scalable manner. Miniature aims to aid researchers in understanding tissue heterogeneity and identifying potential pathological features without extensive manual intervention. Miniature uses a choice of unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods including uniform manifold embedding and projection (UMAP), t-distributed stochastic neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and principal Component analysis (PCA) to reduce on-tissue pixels from a low-resolution, high dimensional image to two or three dimensions. Pixels are then color encoded by their coordinate in low dimensional space using a choice of color maps. We show that perceptually distinct regions in Miniature thumbnails reflect known pathological features seen in both the source multiplexed tissue image and H&E imaging of the same sample. We evaluate Miniature parameters for dimensionality reduction and pixel color encoding to recommend default configurations that maximize perceptual trustworthiness to both the low-dimensional embedding and high-dimensional image and provide high Mantel correlation between the perceived color difference (delta E 2000) and distance in high- and low-dimensional space.

These peptide therapeutics form a class of successful inhibitors. To design such peptide-based inhibitors, stapling is one of the methods in which amino acid side chains are stitched together to get conformationally rigid peptides, ensuring effective binding to their partners. In the current work, we use computer simulations to investigate p53 peptides stapled with hydrocarbon chains of different lengths and positions of attachment to the peptide. We subsequently analyze their binding efficiency with MDM2. The introduction of stapling agents restricts the conformational dynamics of peptides, resulting in higher persistence of helicity. The efficiency of the stapling agents has also been verified imposing these stapled peptides to adverse conditions viz. thermal and chemical denaturation. In addition, the conformational exploration of peptides has been investigated using Temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (T-REMD) simulations. From both the unbiased and T-REMD simulations, p53 with a long hydrocarbon cross-linker shows a more conformationally rigid structure having high helicity compared to other stapled peptides. The rigidity gained due to cross-linking reduces the entropy of the peptide in the free state and thereby facilitates the complexation process. From the binding studies, we have shown that the peptide having multiple short staples has shown a larger enthalpy change during binding free energy, resulting from its orientation and interactions of residues in the binding interface. On the other hand, a peptide with a single long stapling agent shows less entropic penalty than other systems.

Proofreading is typically invoked in the context of error correction and therefore is often inflexible in its discrimination in favor of the cognate ligand. This discrimination is achieved when a multi-step and energy consuming reaction pathway is irreversibly restarted with a rate proportional to the thermodynamic stability of the ligand-bound complex. Here, we present a novel non-equilibrium and tunable kinetic sorting mechanism that allows signaling networks to modulate ligand discrimination in direction as well as in magnitude. In our model, the restart cycle associated with traditional proofreading is coupled with a topologically distinct and ligand-identity independent cycle, e.g., through receptor degradation or activity-induced desensitization. The signaling network can kinetically sort the non-equilibrium flux of receptors bound to one of the ligands towards degradation/desensitization and the other through the restart cycle. This preferential diversion of the non-equilibrium flux allows the network to switch its ligand discrimination by altering biochemical processes that are not specific to the identity of the bound ligand, thereby allowing cells to respond to ligands in a context-specific manner. Our model recapitulates several observations related to paradoxical ligand discrimination by the Epidermal Growth Factor pathway. Given the ubiquity of receptor degradation, activity-induced desensitization, and other similar cycles in cellular signaling networks, tunable ligand discrimination using kinetic sorting is likely to be broadly applicable.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616003", "title": "Single Cells Signal Non-self from Self via 'XOR' and 'NOT EQUALS' Logic in a Dimer of Dimers", "authors": "An, R.; Prakash, M.", "author_corresponding": "Rocky An", "author_corresponding_institution": "Stanford University", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "systems biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.10.01.616003.source.xml", "abstract": "The ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila's seven mating types are defined by unique receptor-ligand pairs (Mta/Mtb).

Interestingly, in the wake state, frontal theta activity increases during effortful cognitive tasks involving executive functions such as working memory, hinting at similarities in circuitry, and potentially, function. The aim of the present work is to create a spatially resolved, whole-brain characterisation of REM oscillatory activity in healthy human subjects, distinguishing theta from neighbouring frequency bands, differentiating substages of REM sleep (phasic and tonic REM), and comparing REM theta to that which is evoked during a working memory task. To that end, we analysed magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) data recorded during overnight sleep in 10 healthy subjects, and similar data from 17 healthy subjects who performed a working memory task, using a novel whole-brain, source-localised MEG approach. Our results show that (i) theta activity has a frontal midline topography that is distinct from those of other prominent frequency bands in REM (delta, alpha, beta), (ii) theta activity in frontal midline regions is best observed within a focused 5-7 Hz range, separating it from occipital alpha activity, (iii) REM theta is dominant over the frontal midline but is also observed in several sub-cortical areas, (iv) theta is more widespread in tonic than phasic REM sleep, and (v) the focused frontal midline theta pattern observed in REM phasic sleep is the most similar of all observed sleep substages to theta evoked by a working memory task.

Our recent work suggests that a primary pathogenic mechanism of Dravet syndrome is impaired action potential propagation along axons of cortical parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons (PVINs). Ectopic action potentials (EAPs) are action potentials that initiate distal to the axon initial segment. We recently demonstrated that a large proportion of PVINs fire EAPs during periods of increased excitation. Although their function remains unknown, EAPs may play a role in amplifying (when occurring in excitatory cells) and/or preventing seizures (when occurring in interneurons). Regardless of function, their generation in distal axons suggests that EAP frequency could be a useful proxy for distal axonal excitability. We hypothesized that EAPs are attenuated in PVINs from Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/-) mice due to dysfunction of the distal axon. We induced EAPs in PVINs in acute brain slices prepared from male and female wildtype (WT) and Scn1a+/- mice at P18-21 and P35-56, when we have previously identified axonal conduction deficits in Scn1a+/- PVINs. We elicited EAPs in 17/22 (77%) of WT PVINs, including 6 (22%) that exhibited barrages of EAPs. In contrast, Scn1a+/- PVINs never fired barrages (0%), and only 8/23 (34%) exhibited even single EAPs. This finding adds to the body of evidence supporting impaired action potential propagation in Dravet syndrome PVINs, and is the first evidence of impaired EAP firing in a disease model, suggesting that dysregulation of EAPs could be involved in the pathophysiology of human disease.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.615823", "title": "Mapping grey and white matter activity in the human brain with isotropic ADC-fMRI", "authors": "Spencer, A.

Out of our positive hits, we focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), mostly known for their role in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. We found that both Mmp1 and Mmp2, which are closely-related to mammalian MMPs, are required in neurons and in glia for the pruning of MB axons. Our combinatorial loss-of-function experiments suggest that Mmp2 secretion from glia is the most important promoter of axon pruning. Our results shed new light on potential molecular players underlying neurodevelopmental defects in SCZ and highlight the advantage of genetically tractable model organisms in the study of human neurodevelopmental disorders.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616052", "title": "STARTS: A self-adapted spatio-temporal framework for automatic E/MEG source imaging", "authors": "Feng, Z.; Guan, C.; Sun, Y.", "author_corresponding": "Yu Sun", "author_corresponding_institution": "the Key Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education of China, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, Zhe", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.10.01.616052.source.xml", "abstract": "To obtain accurate brain source activities, the highly ill posed source imaging of electro and magneto encephalography (E/MEG) requires proficiency in incorporation of biophysiological constraints and signalprocessing techniques.

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), a plasticity mechanism based on prolonged somatic bursts induced by dendritic Ca2+ plateau potentials, was recently proposed as the main cellular mechanism underlying new PF formations (PFF), but it is unknown whether burst-associated large somatic [Ca2+] transients are necessary and/or sufficient for PFF. To address this issue, here we performed in vivo two-photon [Ca2+] imaging of hippocampal CA1 PCs in head-restrained mice to investigate somatic [Ca2+] dynamics underlying PFFs in familiar and novel virtual environments. Our results demonstrate that although many PFs are formed by BTSP-like events, PFs also frequently emerge with initial [Ca2+] dynamics that do not match any of the characteristics of BTSP. BTSP and non-BTSP-like new PFFs occur spontaneously in familiar environments, during neuronal representational switches and instantaneously in new environments.

Methods: Two T1-weighted MPRAGE 3D datasets were acquired at 3T in thirty-seven children, median age 7.75 years; one with conventional linear phase encoding and one using DISORDER. MPRAGE images were scored as motion-free or motion-corrupt. Cortical morphometry and regional brain volumes were measured with FreeSurfer, subcortical grey matter (GM) with FSL-FIRST, and hippocampal volumes with HippUnfold. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine agreement between the 2 MPRAGE acquisitions. Mann-Whitney U was used to test the difference between measures obtained using DISORDER and (i) motion-free and (ii) motion-corrupt conventional MPRAGE data. Results: ICC measures were good/excellent for most subcortical GM (motion-free, 0.75-0.96; motion-corrupt, 0.62-0.98) and regional brain volumes (motion-free 0.47-0.99; motion-corrupt, 0.54-0.99) between conventional MPRAGE and DISORDER data, except for the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (motion-free, 0.38-0.65; motion-corrupt, 0.1-0.42).

Mann-Whitney U showed percentage differences in measures obtained with motion-corrupt conventional MPRAGE compared to DISORDER data were significantly greater than in those obtained using motion-free conventional MPRAGE data in 22/58 structures.

Recent advances in computational modelling allow us to investigate the relationship between FC and neurobiology non-invasively. These techniques allow for targeted manipulations to study the effect of network disturbances on FC. Most modelling research has concentrated on replicating empirical static FC (sFC). However, FC changes over time, and its dynamic properties are closely linked to behaviour and symptomatology. In this study, we adapted computational models to reflect both sFC and dynamic FC (dFC) of individuals, allowing for a more comprehensive characterisation of the neurobiological origins of FC. We modelled the brain activity of 200 healthy individuals based on empirical resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Simulations were conducted using a group-averaged structural connectome and four parameters guiding regional brain activity: i) G, a global coupling scaling parameter; ii) J_i, the local inhibitory current; iii) J_NMDA, the excitatory NMDA synaptic coupling parameter; and iv) w_p, the excitatory population recurrence weight. We evaluated the models based on four metrics: a) the sFC, b) the FC variance, c) the temporal correlation (TC), and d) the node cohesion (NC). The optimal model for each subject was identified by the fit to both sFC and TC. We analysed associations between brain-wide sFC and TC features with optimal model parameters and fits with a univariate correlation approach and multivariate prediction models. In addition, we used a group-average perturbation approach to investigate the effect of coupling in each region on overall network connectivity. Our models could replicate empirical sFC and TC but not the FC variance and NC. Both fits and parameters exhibited strong associations with brain connectivity. G correlated positively and J_NMDA negatively with a range of static and dynamic FC features (|r| > 0.2, p(FDR) < 0.05). TC fit correlated negatively, and sFC fit positively with static and dynamic FC features. TC features were predictive of TC fit, sFC features of sFC fit (R^2 > 0.5). Perturbation analysis revealed that the sFC fit was most impacted by coupling changes in the left paracentral gyrus ({Delta}r = 0.07). In contrast, the left pars triangularis impacted the TC fit most strongly ({Delta}r = 0.24). Our findings indicate that neurobiological characteristics are associated with individual variability in sFC and dFC, and that sFC and dFC are shaped by small sets of distinct regions. In addition, we show that brain network modelling can replicate some, but not all, properties of dFC, and model fits are strongly influenced by specific FC patterns. By modelling both sFC and dFC, we could produce new insights into neurobiological mechanisms of brain network configurations.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616014", "title": "A stable Netrin-1 fluorescent reporter chicken reveals cell-specific molecular signaturesduring optic fissure closure.", "authors": "Chan, B.

For caribou, costs and benefits may vary seasonally and by social context. To test the effects of season and social context on caribou movement and selection of potentially risky habitats, we used a socially informed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA). We tested responses to two forms of risk in Terra Nova National Park, NL: roads and areas burned 2 - 75 years prior. Caribou avoided areas near roads irrespective of season. Burned area avoidance varied by season and burn age. Caribou avoided roads less and selected burns more in a social context.

Using a set of simulation experiments designed to reflect various sampling and observational biases encountered in real-world scenarios, we systematically validate our model and evaluate it's performance relative to other common ASNA methodologies. By accounting for differences in node-level censoring (i.e., the probability of missing an individual interaction.), our model permits the recovery of true latent social connections, even under a wide range of conditions where some key individuals are intermittently unobserved.

Predicting OATP-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is challenging due to limited structural data and inconsistent experimental OATP inhibition data across studies. This study introduces Heterogeneous OATP-Ligand Interaction Graph Neural Network (HOLI-GNN), a novel computational approach that integrates molecular modeling with graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of OATP-mediated drug inhibition. By combining ligand molecular features with protein-ligand interaction data, HOLI-GNN outperforms traditional ligand-based methods. HOLI-GNN achieved median F1 and AUC scores of 0.78 and 0.90, respectively, compared to ECFP- and RDKit-based models built upon XGBoost (F1: 0.68 and 0.78, respectively; AUC: 0.70 and 0.75, respectively). Beyond improving inhibition prediction, we characterize protein residues involved in inhibitory versus non-inhibitory drug interactions, specifically highlighting residues T42, F224, I353, F356, and F386. We speculate that local position shifts in these hydrophobic packing residues, or the inhibition thereof, may be an important aspect of competitive inhibition mechanisms. Our model enhances the performance of OATP inhibitor prediction and, critically, offers interpretable interaction information to inform future mechanistic investigations.\n\nSignificance StatementConcurrent administration of different drugs can cause potentially lethal drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and membrane protein transporters like OATPs can mediate such DDIs. While many current models predict OATP-mediated DDIs, all thus far rely solely on drug features without considering intricate drug-OATP interactions. In this work, we present HOLI-GNN, a graph neural network that leverages both drug and OATP-drug interaction features to predict OATP inhibition. The use of OATP-drug interaction features in the prediction was made possible by the recent publication of cryo-EM structures for OATP1B1 and high-throughput protein-ligand docking.

However, current transcriptomic profiling technologies result in destruction of the biological sample, preventing direct analysis of transcriptional dynamics in the same living cells over time. Here, we developed a synthetic RNA export system called cellular 'self-reporting' to address this fundamental technological limitation. We repurposed the murine leukemia virus retroviral protein Gag to enable diverse types of immortalized and primary mammalian cells to package cellular RNA molecules in virus-like particles (VLPs) for export into the extracellular environment. We applied self-reporting to interrogate the transcriptome-wide dynamics that occur during neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells and detected gene expression profiles from individual live cells. Leveraging this genetically encodable approach, we expanded the capabilities of self-reporting through molecular engineering of VLP components.

EPR spectroscopy reveals the presence of a S state in a high spin configuration (S2HS) and in a low spin configuration (S2LS) in both mutants. In contrast to the (S2HS in the wild type at high pH, the (S2HS state in the D1-V185T mutant does not progress to the S3 state at 198 K. This inability is likely due to alterations in the protonation state and hydrogen-bonding network around the Mn4CaO5 cluster. Optical studies show that these mutations significantly affect proton release during the S3-to-S0 transition. While the initial fast proton release associated with TyrZdot formation remains unaffected within the resolution of our measurements, the second, and slower, proton release is delayed, suggesting that the mutations disrupt the hydrogen-bonding interactions necessary for efficient deprotonation of substrate water (O6). This disruption in proton transfer also correlates with slower water exchange in the S3 state, likely due to non-native hydrogen bonds introduced by the threonine or asparagine side chains at position 185.

Also, GFPs serve as fluorescent tags in size-exclusion chromatography and native-PAGE, facilitating the evaluation of expression levels and quality of the expressed fusion proteins. However, the fluorescent detection of GFPs is generally incompatible with denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), where the samples are heat-denatured before loading. Accordingly, detecting GFP-fused proteins after SDS-PAGE usually relies on western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies. To enable in-gel fluorescence detection of SDS-PAGE-separated GFPs, some protocols employ mild denaturing conditions to keep the GFPs intact. However, such mild denaturation sometimes results in partial denaturation of the proteins and irregular electrophoretic mobility that is not proportional to their molecular weights. Here, we demonstrate that the fully denatured GFPs can be refolded within the gel by cyclodextrin-mediated removal of SDS in the presence of 20% methanol, enabling the in-gel fluorescence detection of the GFP-fused proteins.

Oligomerization and the loss of an inhibitory myristoylation modification lead to unregulated kinase activity of the BCR-ABL and TEL-ABL fusion proteins. ATP-competitive ABL inhibitors, such as imatinib and ponatinib, are effective against both fusion proteins. We discovered that asciminib, an allosteric inhibitor of BCR-ABL that binds to the myristoyl binding site in the ABL kinase domain, is 2000-fold less potent against TEL-ABL than BCR-ABL in cell-growth assays. This is surprising because the ABL components of the two fusion proteins, including the asciminib binding sites, have identical sequence. We deleted a short helical segment in the ABL kinase domain that closes over asciminib when it is bound. This deletion results in asciminib resistance in BCR-ABL, but has no effect on TEL-ABL, suggesting that the native autoinhibitory mechanism that asciminib engages in BCR-ABL is disrupted in TEL-ABL. We show, using mammalian cell expression and single-molecule microscopy, that BCR-ABL is mainly dimeric while TEL-ABL forms higher-order oligomers. Oligomerization can promote trans-autophosphorylation of ABL, and we find that a regulatory phosphorylation site in the SH3 domain of ABL (Tyr 89) is highly phosphorylated in TEL-ABL. This phosphorylation is expected to disassemble the autoinhibited conformation of ABL, thereby preventing asciminib binding. We show that TEL-ABL is intrinsically susceptible to inhibition by asciminib, but that increased phosphorylation results in resistance.

HBDs bind histones through multi-contact interactions that may confer more specificity than antibodies, but are hard to study because of their weaker affinity in vitro.

Previous work created an AgDNV co-expression system with a wild-type AgDNV helper plasmid and a transducing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressing plasmid that can be used to cotransfect cells to generate infectious recombinant transducing AgDNV virions. Generated virions infect the An. gambiae midgut, fat body, and ovaries, yet this viral vector system is limited in the size of transgenes that can be expressed due to capsid packaging limitations. Considering these size constraints, we created an artificial intron within the EGFP gene of the transducing construct that can express small pieces of genetic material such as microRNAs (miRNAs), microRNA sponges, or other small sequences. Placement of this intron in EGFP created a fluorescent reporter such that incorrect splicing produces a frameshift mutation in EGFP and an early stop codon whereas correct splicing results in normal EGFP expression and cotranscription of the intronic genetic cargo. A selection of miRNAs with predicted or demonstrated importance in mosquito immunity and reproduction with expression localized to the fat body or ovaries were chosen as intronic cargo, construct expression and splicing evaluated, and the impact of miRNA expression on putative miRNA targets was measured in vitro and in vivo. While the intron was correctly spliced in cells and mosquitoes, miRNA delivery resulted in inconsistent changes to miRNA and target gene transcript levels; possibly due to organ-specific miRNA expression or miRNA-target gene sequence mismatch.

We used polysulfides to treat proteins including roGFP2, Trx1, and DsbA under anaerobic condition and found that all three proteins formed intramolecular DSB in vitro. The growth of E. coli {Delta}dsbB was reduced and the amount of its intracellular protein DSB was decreased under anaerobic condition.

Treating E. coli {Delta}dsbA with polysulfides promoted DSB formation of its periplasmic roGFP2 and recovered its growth under anaerobic condition.

We thus established a doxorubicin-induced model of cellular senescence to establish a senotype (gene/protein signature of a senescence cell state) for ovarian senescent cells. Explants of human postmenopausal ovarian cortex and medulla were treated with doxorubicin for 24 hours followed by culture for up to 10 days in a doxorubicin-free medium. Tissue viability was confirmed by histology, lack of apoptosis, and continued glucose consumption by explants.

We identified distinct senescence profiles for the cortex and medulla, driven predominantly by epithelial and stromal cells. Proteomics uncovered subregional differences in addition to 120 proteins common to the cortex and medulla SASP.

Clinical use of Scl-Ab is indicated for postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis who are at high risk of, or have a history of, fragility fractures, which can occur many years after menopause. However, in early stages of estrogen deficiency there is rapid bone loss, which abates thereafter, whereas in the longer-term changes in bone mineralization occur. This study seeks to investigate whether administering intermittent low-dose monthly sclerostin antibody during early estrogen deficiency could mitigate osteoclastogenesis but also prevent osteocyte-driven secondary mineralization, due to apoptosis, perilacunar remodelling and osteocyte mechanosensitivity. Female Wistar rats that had completed their breeding cycles underwent bilateral ovariectomy as a model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. After 3 weeks of bone loss, one group received monthly low-dose Scl-Ab injections (2 mg/kg/month) and a control group remained untreated. We report that early treatment with intermittent low-dose Scl-Ab mildly increased bone formation, reduced TRAP+ osteoclasts and suppressed catabolic and matrix degradation gene expression (Sost, Ctsk, Mmp9) compared to untreated rats. There was a decrease in the percentage of empty lacunae and MMP14+ osteocytes, along with decreased gene expression associated with osteocyte-mediated mineralization (DMP1, PHEX, OPN, ALP) and mechanotransduction (Vcl, integrins 5, V, {beta}1, CX43, Axin2, IFT88, Adcy6, Pkd1, and Cav1). Thus, we propose that early intervention with intermittent low-dose Scl-Ab therapy can promote surface bone formation but reduce osteocyte-mediated secondary mineralization after initial bone loss.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616120", "title": "Ternary complex formation of VCP, VCPIP1 and p47 facilitates Golgi reassembly", "authors": "Shah, B.; Hunkeler, M.; Bratt, A.; Yue, H.; Jaen Maisonet, I.; Fischer, E.

We recently reported on the imiditides, a new RiPP family in which aspartimidylation is the class-defining modification. Imiditide biosynthetic gene clusters encode a precursor protein and a methyltransferase that methylates a specific Asp residue, converting it to aspartimide. A subset of imiditides harbor a tetracysteine motif, so we have named these molecules cysimiditides. Here, using genome mining we show that there are 56 putative cysimiditides predicted in publicly available genome sequences, all within actinomycetota. We successfully heterologously expressed two examples of cysimiditides and showed that the major products are aspartimidylated and that the tetracysteine motif is necessary for expression. Cysimiditides bind a Zn2+ ion, presumably at the tetracysteine motif. Using in vitro reconstitution of the aspartimidylation reaction, we show that Zn2+ is required for methylation and subsequent aspartimidylation of the precursor protein. An AlphaFold 3 model of the cysimiditide from Thermobifida cellulosilytica shows a hairpin structure anchored by the Zn2+-tetracysteine motif with the aspartimide site in the hairpin loop. An AlphaFold 3 model of this cysimiditide in complex with its cognate methyltransferase suggests that the methyltransferase recognizes the Zn2+-tetracysteine motif to correctly dock the precursor protein. Cysimiditides expand the set of experimentally-confirmed RiPPs harboring aspartimides, and represent the first RiPP class that has an obligate metal ion.\n\nTable of Contents Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616296v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13f91c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c4496org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7aeec5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d1edb6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616211", "title": "Cross-catalytic enhancement of peptides and RNA from a common prebiotic activated intermediate", "authors": "Roy, R.; Sawant, A.

While the PACAP-38 isoform is more densely expressed than PACAP-27 in most of the brain, PACAP-27 is more highly expressed in the rodent paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), where females also have greater expression than males. Notably, the role of PACAP-27 expression in cells of the PVT has not been explored. Methods: Adult, female Long-Evans rats were injected in the PVT with an AAV to increase expression of PACAP or a control AAV. They were then investigated for subsequent gene and peptide levels of PACAP in the PVT; ethanol drinking and preference; sucrose drinking and preference; or locomotor activity in a novel chamber, behavior in a light-dark box, behavior in a novelty suppression of feeding test, locomotor activity in a familiar activity chamber, and behavior in a forced swim test. Results: Gene expression of PACAP was significantly increased in the PVT by four weeks after injection with the PACAP AAV, and this resulted in a specific increase in levels of PACAP-27. Rats injected with the PACAP AAV demonstrated reduced drinking and preference for ethanol under the intermittent-access procedure compared to those injected with the control AAV. In contrast, rats injected with the PACAP AAV showed no significant difference in drinking or preference for sucrose, or in any affective behavior tested, except that they spent less time swimming in the forced swim test. Conclusions: In light of the low overall level of expression of PACAP-27 in the brain, the ability of PACAP-27 in the PVT to control ethanol drinking, with minimal effects on other motivated or affective behaviors, supports the idea that compounds related to PACAP-27 should be investigated as potential therapeutics for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.615879", "title": "Hierarchical Organization of Visual Feature Attention Control", "authors": "Meyyappan, S.; Ding, M.; Mangun, G.

This anticipatory feature-based attention involves top-down neural control signals from a frontoparietal network that bias visual cortex to enhance the processing of attended information and suppress distraction. So, for example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. But as well, anticipatory attention can be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs. green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where participants were cued to either attend to a color (blue or green) or a motion direction (up or down) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band (8-12 Hz) activity during the attention control period (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (color vs. motion) and specific feature attributes (blue vs. green; up vs. down). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (color vs. motion) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (e.g., blue vs. green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first selecting the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing selection to the specific feature attribute.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616300", "title": "Neural dynamics of spontaneous memory recall and future thinking in the continuous flow of thoughts", "authors": "Su, H.; Li, X.; Born, S.; Honey, C.

These neural responses to internally generated thought boundaries produce activation patterns resembling those triggered by external event boundaries. Moreover, interactions within and between these networks shape the overall semantic structure of thought trajectories: stronger functional connectivity within the medial temporal subsystem of the default network predicts greater variability in thoughts, while stronger connectivity between the control and core default networks is associated with reduced variability.

Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the major capsid protein presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage-phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis.

We explore these questions in Drosophila sensory organ precursors (SOPs), which divide asymmetrically to give rise to the epidermal mechanosensory bristles.

The influence of auditory feedback is best illustrated by manipulating it during speech production. A common temporal manipulation technique, delaying auditory feedback (DAF), leads to disruptions in speech fluency, while a common spectral manipulation technique, perturbing the pitch of auditory feedback (PAF), results in vocal alterations. Previous research involving clinical populations has revealed diverse susceptibility profiles to auditory feedback manipulations, yet the extent of such diversity within the neurotypical population remains unclear. Furthermore, different types of manipulations elicit distinct speech errors (i.e. fluency/coordination versus acoustic errors), which may be processed by distinct error correction mechanisms. It is yet to be understood whether individuals affected by one manipulation are similarly impacted by the other. Lastly, based on evidence from clinical studies, which demonstrated that visual feedback can improve impaired speech production, it is an open question whether visual feedback can alleviate the disruptive effects of altered auditory feedback. We recorded voice samples from 40 neurotypical participants during both a DAF and a PAF task. DAF significantly prolonged articulation duration and increased voice pitch and intensity. In some trials, participants received immediate visual feedback, however visual feedback did not alleviate but rather strengthened the disruptive effects of DAF. During the PAF task, participants adjusted their voice pitch in the opposite direction of the perturbation in majority of the trials to compensate for the perturbation. We assessed susceptibility of the participants to the effects of DAF and PAF by examining articulation duration and compensatory vocal response magnitude, respectively.

Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized function of the molecular motor protein KIF11, which acts as a MT dynamics rheostat in hippocampal neurons to modulate dendritic branching. Known for its role in mitotic spindle bipolarity, KIF11 is also implicated in Microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or intellectual disabilities (MCLID). However, the specific neuronal functions of KIF11 and the impact of its mutations in MCLID have remained largely unexplored. Our studies, using quantitative imaging of MT dynamics following KIF11 inhibition, indicate that KIF11 preferentially binds to parallel MTs in mature neurons. This binding is associated with a marked increase in minus-end-out MT dynamics in both axons and dendrites upon KIF11 loss of function, coupled with enhanced MT flux and extended growth in tertiary dendrites. These changes suggest a novel role for KIF11 in orchestrating dendritic branching. Moreover, introducing MCLID-associated KIF11 mutations, KIF11Y82F, and KIF11{Delta}Cterm, which cause minor microcephaly but severe intellectual disabilities, leads to significantly reduced MT dynamics and impaired dendritic arborization. In a microtubule sliding assay, KIF11Y82F significantly reduced KIF11 velocity while KIF11{Delta}Cterm increased it. Temporal inhibition of KIF11 using a photo-inhibitable KIF11, show increased MT dynamics and dendritic growth, while activation results in kinked and twisted branches.

Several studies have reported that a wide range of metabolic markers is present in blood, urine and brain samples of ASD patients. In this study, using transcriptome data of neurons derived from ASD and control individuals, we reconstructed neuron-specific metabolic network models for two neurodevelopmental time points representing late neural progenitor stage and mature neurons. We simulate gene inactivation in these networks to investigate the altered metabolic fluxes and biological pathways in ASD metabolism. We further examine these networks using reporter metabolite analysis to identify those metabolites around which significant gene expression changes occur. Briefly, our model was successful in predicting previously reported metabolites and pathways implicated in ASD metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, and points to a new finding concerning alterations in the less studied pathways like keratan sulfate degradation pathway and N/O-glycosylation in ASD. Finally, by employing the robust metabolic transformation algorithm (rMTA) we set to find potential drug targets that can reverse the ASD metabolic state into a healthy one.

Additionally, rapamycin significantly altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic functions, shifting the Bacteroides to Firmicutes ratio and increasing amino acid bioavailability in the gut lumen.

This model and its extension show that WPC growth, net primary productivity and other carbon budgets - such as total primary productivity, autotrophic respiration, organ turnover biomass and non-structural carbohydrates - can be expressed as functions of current biomass, maintenance respiration rate per unit biomass and stand age or Mmax. These functions are globally convergent, allowing us to estimate the current (2018-2020) global Mmax at 1451 Pg based on the current state of WPCs alone, with a growth potential of 518 Pg, 83% of which is attributable to shrublands. By the end of the century, climate change is projected to reduce the total Mmax by 266 Pg, mainly in species-rich evergreen broadleaf forests. Further analysis indicates that species richness increases the climate sensitivity of Mmax, while soil organic and moisture affects the direction of this response.

The presence of multiple {Delta}9 desaturases has posed a significant challenge in developing a rapid and efficient approach to control UFA production in C. elegans and other model organisms.

Hence, it is crucial to improve our mechanistic understanding of GBM invasion phenotype, in the hope of inhibiting the disease progression. Here, we used patient-derived GBM neurospheres as a model to study GBM invasion. When these neurospheres were cultured in Matrigel, the GBM cells spontaneously invaded the surrounding microenvironment. We first characterized the invasion rate through live imaging and the forces exerted by cells as they invade the Matrigel using traction force microscopy (TFM) analysis. We observed a significant increase in cellular contractility as the cells invaded the surrounding Matrigel, prompting us to investigate the role of myosin in the cell invasion. To test this, the GBM neurospheres were treated with a myosin inhibitor, Blebbistatin. Myosin inhibition led to reduced GBM invasion and contractility. Furthermore, we investigated the role of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and showed that GBM invasion relies on MMP activity in the absence of myosin.

In healthy cells, aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation are counteracted by chaperone proteins whose protective capacity decreases with age. The role of the chaperone Hsp90 and the mechanism by which it can prevent Tau aggregation toxicity are controversial. The innovative strategy of mimicking Hsp90 through the design of the {beta}-hairpin like peptidomimetic {beta}-Hsp90, inspired by two Hsp90/Tau interaction sequences, is presented here. {beta}-Hsp90 inhibits Tau aggregation both in vitro and in cells, restoring Tau's physiological interaction with microtubules. {beta}-Hsp90, which interacts with the P1 region of Tau, is more effective than individual peptide sequences from the chaperone HSP90 and another {beta}-hairpin mimic based on Tau sequences.

However, the regulation of specific transcriptional signatures and the contribution of each individual response to disease progression is only starting to be characterized. We have previously shown that hypoxia via hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a strong regulator of A{beta} plaque-associated microglia (A{beta}AM). Here, we characterize the role of HIF1-mediated transcription of Egln3, encoding for PHD3, in A {beta}AM. We show that oligomeric A {beta} treatment (oA{beta}) in vitro induces the expression of Hif1a and Egln3 in microglia, which correlates with the transcriptional activation of genes involved in the interferon type I signature (IFNS) in a PHD3-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we demonstrate FOXO3 to be an important repressor of IFNS in microglia, whose abundance decreases upon A{beta} presence, and, correspondingly, both in human single-nucleus (sn) and mouse A{beta}AM transcriptomics, FOXO3 DNA binding sites define the IFNS. FOXO3 repression of the IFNS is dependent on PHD3, with our results suggesting a physical interaction between both proteins in vitro. In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature (DAM) in A{beta}AM. Transcriptional changes in microglia associate with increased microglia proximity to A{beta} plaques, augmented phagocytosis of A{beta} by microglia, reduced parenchymal levels of A{beta}, and an increase in small-sized plaques. PHD3 deficiency also reduced the A{beta} plaque-associated neuropathology and rescued behavioural deficits of an AD mouse model. Finally, we also demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression during development in the absence of A{beta} pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioural alterations. Altogether, our data strongly indicate that the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, contributing to the progression of AD.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.615787", "title": "Representation of male features in the female mouse Accessory Olfactory Bulb, and their stability during the estrus cycle", "authors": "Ben-Shaul, Y.; Cohen, O.", "author_corresponding": "Yoram Ben-Shaul", "author_corresponding_institution": "The Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.01.615787.source.xml", "abstract": "Most behaviors result from integration of external and internal inputs. For example, social behavior requires information about conspecifics and internal physiological states. Like many other mammals, female mice undergo a reproductive cycle during which their physiology and behavioral responses to males change dramatically: during estrus, they are more receptive to male mating attempts. A critical element in reproductive behavior is the investigative stage, which in mice, and many other species, strongly relies on chemosensation. While the initial approach mostly involves the main olfactory system (MOS), once physical contact is established, the vomeronasal system (VNS) is engaged to provide information about potential partners' characteristics. Given the estrus-stage dependent behavioral response, we asked whether representations of male features in the first brain relay of the VNS, namely, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), change during the cycle. To this end, we used a stimulus set comprising urine samples from males from different strains and virility levels, and from estrus and non-estrus females. The stimulus set was designed to reveal if response patterns of AOB neurons conform to ethologically relevant dimensions such as sex, strain, and particularly, male virility state. Using extracellular recordings in anesthetized female mice, we find that most ethological categories contained in our data set are not over-represented by AOB neurons, suggesting that early stages of VNS processing encode conspecific information efficiently. Then, comparing neuronal activity in estrus and non-estrus females, we found that overall, response characteristics at the single neuron and population levels remain stable during the reproductive cycle. The few changes that do occur, are not consistent with a systematic modulation of responses to male features.

Factor purification has involved fractionation of ovine and bovine ovarian follicular fluid and blood plasma and serum, with evaluation via rat bioassays in vivo and in vitro. Analysis averse, the molecular effector provided a chemical conundrum. Evidence from mass spectrometry (MS) has been problematic, with spectra from MALDI-TOF, the only productive MS modality, confused by a target polypeptide exhibiting artefacts during processing, storage and MALDI set-up in terms of C-terminal truncation and water losses, together with N-terminal grand fragmentations and dimerizations (factor fragments doubled up). Evidence from chemical sequencing of amino acid (aa) residues was likewise baffling, but consistent with a spiralised depolymerisation within the Edman reaction chamber of a unitary polypeptide. Data decryption has overcome molecular intractability, supported by the results of tryptic digestion and epitope mapping using immunohistochemistry (IHC).

This difficulty arises from challenges in accurately representing the soil environment and in establishing a tractable microbial community that limits confounding variables. To address these challenges in our investigation of community metabolism, we use a reduced-complexity microbial consortium grown in a soil analog using a glass-bead matrix amended with chitin. Long-read and short-read metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metaproteomes, and metabolomes were analyzed to test the effects of soil structure and moisture on chitin degradation. Our soil structure analog system greatly altered microbial expression profiles compared to the liquid-only incubations, emphasizing the importance of incorporating environmental parameters, like pores and surfaces, for understanding microbial phenotypes relevant to soil ecosystems. These changes were mainly driven by differences in overall expression of chitin-degrading Streptomyces species and stress-tolerant Ensifer. Our findings suggest that the success of Ensifer in a structured environment is likely related to its ability to repurpose carbon via the glyoxylate shunt while potentially using polyhydroxyalkanoate granules as a C source. We also identified traits like motility, stress resistance, and biofilm formation that underlie the degradation of chitin across our treatments and inform how they may ultimately alter carbon use efficiency.

We compared bird predation on plasticine caterpillar models to that on dead caterpillars of similar size and color, using camera traps and observer posterior assessment to identify biases and quantify actual predation events. Although camera trap analyses revealed that birds respond similarly to plasticine models and dead caterpillars, suggesting no advantage in using dead prey for assessing avian predation, the results of posterior identification of predation marks showed contradictory results, making the interpretation of the results ambiguous. Observer inconsistencies in detecting predation clues on models highlight potential biases, with camera trap data showing these clues do not reliably indicate actual bird predation.

We identified two major pulses of coevolutionary expansion: one predating the divergence of fungi and animals, and another predating the origin of animals. Our reconstruction also infers a polyphyletic origin for the atypical MAPKs. Integrating functional literature across eukaryotic taxa with our reconstructed trees reveals that the two clades of MAP3K, Sterile-like (STE) and tyrosine kinase-like (TKL), had distinct evolutionary trajectories and influences on downstream pathway diversification. STEs that function as MAP3Ks are conserved across extant eukaryotes. Despite the absence of TKL MAP3Ks in many early diverging eukaryotes, the expansion of TKL MAP3Ks aligns phylogenetically and functionally with that of the downstream MAP2Ks and MAPKs. We thus propose that the MAPK network originated as a STE-regulated pathway, and that subsequent radiations of the TKLs drove the diversification of downstream components and top-down finetuning of pathway specificity. We thus provide an evolutionary framework for generating novel hypotheses on the functional diversity of this key signaling network, including potential insights into the evolution of animal multicellularity.

This creates dynamic artificial light conditions for insects and arachnids, including predators used in biological control. Despite increasing interest, the effects of LEDs on predator behavior and control performance remain poorly understood. In the laboratory, we examined the locomotion and predation behaviors of the generalist predator Orius insidiosus against the pest Frankliniella occidentalis under various light spectra and intensities. We tested narrowband blue, green, and red spectra, three ratios of red and blue light, and a spectrum combining all three colors across a gradient of light intensity in microcosms. Orius insidiosus was active and successfully attacked prey under all lighting conditions, with 70% of individuals engaging in predation during the observation period. The light spectrum significantly influenced all recorded behaviors, while light intensity had negligible effects. Narrowband spectra led to the highest attack probabilities, but the mixed blue-red spectrum with a higher proportion of red light yielded the highest prey capture rates. The spectrum with all three colors showed intermediate capture success. These trends were consistent regarding capture probability in more complex environments with cucumber plants, where thrips were exposed to 24-hour artificial light sequences before and during predator releases. However, thrips survival rates remained similar across all lighting treatments. Our results demonstrated that while lighting treatments affect predator behavior, Orius insidiosus retains its ability to capture prey under various light conditions. This paves the way for developing lighting strategies that balance plant productivity with effective biological control in protected crop environments.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.615599", "title": "A simple action reduces food intake and obesity in mice", "authors": "Barrett, M.

However, in such experiments high-fat diet is typically provided freely to animals, so it remains unclear how increasing dietary fat would impact body weight if the high-fat diet required more effort to obtain. Here, we hypothesized that unrestricted access is necessary for mice to overeat high fat diets, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diets would reduce food intake and weight gain in a high-fat diet model of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized home-cage-based feeding devices that either provided food freely or required mice to briefly poke their noses into a port - a simple action that is easy for them to do - to receive food. With both low-fat and high fat diets, requiring mice to nose-poke just one time to access food strongly reduced food intake, and in the case of high-fat diet, prevented the development of obesity. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating in mice, and that making mice perform a simple action such as a nose-poke to access food reduces over eating and weight gain.

Current anti-estrogen therapies, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, have limitations, including partial agonist activity and resistance development, which evidence the need for more potent alternatives. Endoxifen, a metabolite of tamoxifen, has emerged as a promising breast cancer therapeutic candidate due to its superior anti-estrogenic effects and side effect profile. The omics signatures for endoxifen, tamoxifen and fulvestrant, obtained from publicly available datasets, were aggregated and harmonized by means of the PandaOmics platform, a commercially available target-discovery platform using multiple AI engines including generative pretrained transformers. Pathway enrichment analyses provided insight into these agents mechanisms of action (MOA) in breast cancer. The analyses revealed unexpected variances in several key pathways from expected interactions via estrogen-dependent and independent effects. All three drugs downregulated estrogen signaling and cell cycle-related pathways, such as E2F targets, G2-M checkpoints, Myc targets, and mitotic spindle, and stimulated apoptosis. Fulvestrant and tamoxifen activated pro-inflammatory and immune pathways and perturbed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Endoxifen perturbed the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway, pursuant to distinct molecular mechanisms compared to its parent compound, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant. In summary, advanced AI-driven methodologies demonstrate the capacity to analyze multi-omics data in a comparative way to advance the understanding of endocrine therapy mechanisms in breast cancer.

Additional investigation using exogenous delivery of PpIX also shows higher cell killing in drug resistant cells, under conditions which achieve approximately the same intracellular PpIX.

Selectively targeting LT{beta}R nonclassical NF{kappa}B pathways on both tumors and LECs cocultured with Tregs, inhibited tumor growth and migration in vitro. Further, we identified protumorigenic chemokines and interferon-stimulated response genes selectively driven by LT{beta}R nonclassical NF{kappa}B in melanoma cells.

Our previous studies demonstrated that HER2 interacts with the calcium pump, PMCA2, and the scaffolding molecules, NHERF1 and Ezrin to stabilize HER2/HSP90 interactions and contribute to the retention of active HER2 at the plasma membrane. In the normal mammary epithelium where apical/basal polarity is tightly regulated by junctional proteins, HER2 is expressed at the basolateral membrane and interacts with the LAP family member, Erbin, whereas PMCA2, NHERF1, and Ezrin localize to the apical membrane. Here, we show that loss of apical membrane polarity in hyperplastic lesions of MMTV-Neu mammary glands or in human DCIS leads to intermixing of these molecules and allows Erbin to interact with NHERF1, Ezrin and HER2 initially within the basolateral membrane and then more diffusely within the plasma membrane. In SKBR3 cells, Erbin physically interacts with NHERF1, Ezrin and HER2 in actin-rich membrane protrusions that we have previously described to be sites of active HER2 signaling. Knockdown of Erbin in these cells reduced HER2 signaling by disrupting the formation of a HER2/NHERF1/Ezrin/HSP90 protein complex in the membrane protrusions. Furthermore, inhibition of Ezrin or knock-down of NHERF1 expression disrupted the ability of Erbin to interact with HER2.

By contrast, lipophilic siRNAs are readily chemically synthesized at scale and support sufficient cardiac and skeletal muscle delivery. In this work, we refine siRNA design elements to enhance potency and durability and support clinically relevant silencing in muscle. Applying this strategy for siRNAs targeting myostatin (MSTN), a key target in muscle-wasting conditions, we show that a single subcutaneous dose in mice achieved robust and durable silencing (~80% inhibition up to 6 weeks, ~30% at 14 weeks). Biweekly dosing resulted in >95% reduction of circulating MSTN for half a year, with no observed systemic or target-related toxicity. MSTN inhibition resulted in muscle growth and increased lean muscle mass, correlating with improved grip strength. Interestingly, the functional impact on muscle growth and strength significantly outlasts the target silencing, suggesting extended pharmacological effects.

However, there remains a lack of mathematical models to elucidate and predict molecular behaviours in a plasticity programme using omics time-series data. Here we report a new mathematical framework that models cell plasticity as a multi-step completion process, where the system moves from the initial state along a path guided by multiple intermediate attractors until the final state (i.e. a new homeostasis) is reached. In benchmarking tests, we show that our developed Control Point (CP) model fits omics time-series data and identifies attractor states that are well-aligned with prior knowledge.

Infested flour exhibited reductions in total soluble sugars, triacylglycerol levels, and unsaturated fatty acids, particularly Oleic and Linoleic acid, while secondary metabolites such as phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins were increased. Behavioural assays revealed that adult beetles were significantly more attracted towards infested flour odour due to the presence of 4,8-Dimethyldecanal (4,8-DMD), an aggregation pheromone of T. castaneum. Another key compound in infested flour, 1-Pentadecene, derived from the beetles' cuticular wax, was found to influence adult beetle behaviour. At higher concentrations, 1-Pentadecene acted as a repellent for the species. Molecular docking studies suggested that 1-Pentadecene competes with 4,8-DMD for binding to the odorant receptor TcOR1, which could potentially inhibit aggregation behaviour and reduce population growth. The docking analysis revealed that 1-Pentadecene interacts with the same binding pocket on TcOR1, sharing key amino acids (MET49, PHE69, THR72, GLN73, THR134, VAL135, TYR138, LEU154, ILE177, GLY180, ALA181, TYR286) and forming similar intermolecular bonds, such as a pi-alkyl bond, with a binding affinity ({Delta}G =-5.7) comparable to 4,8-DMD ({Delta}G =-5.8).

In this study, we set out to establish a protocol to produce long lived, pure neuronal cultures from zebrafish that could be used to study the mechanistic contributions of genes to neuronal networks.

Specifically, we find that loss of scn1lab promotes hyperproliferation of non-neuronal cells in mixed cultures of brain cells. In pure neuronal cultures, we find alterations in neurotransmitter subtypes consistent with known effects of scn1lab loss of function.

Research has highlighted the crucial role of gut microbiota in overall health, including cognition and neurodegenerative disorders. Cancer patients receiving pelvic radiation often experience gut dysbiosis and this may induce changes in brain through the bi-directional connection between the gut microbiota and the brain, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Bacterial supplements intended to enhance health, whether consumed orally or applied topically. However, the mechanism of bacterial supplements to mitigate pelvic radiation-induced metabolomic alterations is not understood. To investigate this, we employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate how these supplements might mitigate radiation-induced metabolomic changes in the rat brain. A single 6 Gy dose of pelvic radiation was administered to 3-4-month-old Sprague Dawley rats and formulated bacterial supplements were given accordingly. Faecal bacterial sequencing and brain metabolomics performed to identify the changes in the gut microbiota and brain metabolomic analysis to check the altered brain metabolites post pelvic radiation. High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing revealed significant shifts in bacterial composition, with reduced diversity in the radiation group compared to controls, which was restored in the supplementation groups. Notably, the dominant genera in the radiation group included Methanobrevibacter, while Parasutterella and Brachyspira were prevalent in the supplementation cohorts. Untargeted metabolomic analysis identified 2,554 annotated metabolites, with 56 showing significant differences across groups. Principal Component Analysis demonstrated distinct metabolomic profiles between irradiated and control groups, with specific metabolomic pathways like retinol and glycerophospholipid metabolism altered by irradiation. Bacterial supplementation significantly attenuated these metabolomic disruptions.

For many years, riluzole was the only approved drug and it offered modest benefits. In 2017, edaravone was approved for ALS and became the first drug to be used in combination with riluzole. In the present study, we have attempted to build on the concepts of combinatorial therapy by testing novel drug combinations in a transgenic mouse model. Mice that express A315T mutant TDP43, using the mouse prion promoter, have been reported to develop many of the symptoms of ALS, including paralysis. Aberrant TDP43 function is a common feature in sporadic ALS, and thus TDP43 transgenic models may recapitulate disease processes that occur in humans with sporadic ALS. Although the PrP.TDP43-A315T model has been reported to develop abnormalities in gut motility that contribute to early mortality, recent studies indicated that gut motility issues could be mitigated by feeding mice with gel-based diets rather than the standard dry chow. In the present study, we have attempted to use the PrP.TDP43-A315T model to test whether we could identify a drug combination that synergized to extend life span in this model substantially. The drug combinations were built around the existing drug modalities, adding additional drugs that had indications of utility from the literature.

Both rhythmic and broadband processes contribute to the neural power spectrum, which decomposes the variance of a neural recording across frequencies. Although an extensive body of literature has successfully studied rhythms in various diseases and brain states, researchers only recently have systematically studied the characteristics of broadband effects in the power spectrum. Broadband effects can generally be categorized as 1) shifts in power across all frequencies, which correlate with changes in local firing rates and 2) changes in the overall shape of the power spectrum, such as the spectral slope or power law exponent. Shape changes are evident in various conditions and brain states, influenced by factors such as excitation to inhibition balance, age, and various diseases. It is increasingly recognized that broadband and rhythmic effects can interact on a sub-second timescale. For example, broadband power is time-locked to the phase of <1 Hz rhythms in propofol induced unconsciousness. Modeling tools that explicitly deal with both rhythmic and broadband contributors to the power spectrum and that capture their interactions are essential to help improve the interpretability of power spectral effects. Here, we introduce a tractable stochastic forward modeling framework designed to capture both narrowband and broadband spectral effects when prior knowledge or theory about the primary biophysical processes involved is available. Population-level neural recordings are modeled as the sum of filtered point processes (FPPs), each representing the contribution of a different biophysical process such as action potentials or postsynaptic potentials of different types. Our approach builds on prior neuroscience FPP work by allowing multiple interacting processes and time-varying firing rates and by deriving theoretical power spectra and cross-spectra. We demonstrate several properties of the models, including that they divide the power spectrum into frequency ranges dominated by rhythmic and broadband effects, and that they can capture spectral effects across multiple timescales, including sub-second cross-frequency coupling. The framework can be used to interpret empirically observed power spectra and cross-frequency coupling effects in biophysical terms, which bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental results.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616107", "title": "Brainstem neurons coordinate the bladder and urethra sphincter for urination", "authors": "Li, X.; Li, X.; Li, J.; Qin, H.; Liang, S.; Li, J.; Jian, T.; Wang, X.; Yin, L.; Yuan, C.; Liao, X.; Jia, H.; Chen, X.; Yao, J.", "author_corresponding": "Xiaowei Chen", "author_corresponding_institution": "Army Medical University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.01.616107.source.xml", "abstract": "Urination, a vital and conserved process of emptying urine from the urinary bladder in mammals, requires precise coordination between the bladder and external urethra sphincter (EUS) that is tightly controlled by a complex neural network.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, their efficacy remains limited in tumors with minimal lymphocyte infiltration. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. Methods We designed a chimeric cytokine receptor (ChCR) that triggers STAT1 signaling upon stimulation with IL-10 or TGF{beta}, cytokines prevalent in the TME that typically drive immunosuppression. Human primary macrophages were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the ChCR, and changes in their phenotype, secretome, and transcriptome were analyzed following stimulation. The anti-tumoral activity of these reprogrammed macrophages was assessed using co-culture assays with 3D TNBC spheroids. Results ChCR expressing macrophages showed robust STAT1 activation in response to IL-10 or TGF{beta} stimulation, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype similar to IFN{gamma} activation, as confirmed by phenotypic markers, and transcriptomic profiling. These ChCR-stimulated macrophages demonstrated significant anti-tumoral effects in 3D TNBC spheroids. Moreover, ChCR stimulation led to the upregulation of genes associated with good response to ICIs, among others CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines essential for lymphocyte recruitment. Secretion of CXCL10 was also confirmed by ELISA. Conclusion We successfully engineered a ChCR that reprograms TAMs within an IL-10- and TGF{beta}-rich environment, inducing an inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumoral activity. The expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 further supports lymphocyte recruitment, potentially facilitating greater lymphocyte infiltration and disrupting the immunosuppressive TME.

The planarian field has made significant progress in identifying specific genes and cell types required for this complex process, but substantially less is known about the molecular mechanisms that convert a significant physical injury (e.g., head amputation) into the expression of specific genes in particular cell types. One tissue in which this question is particularly relevant is the planarian epidermis, a single-layer, mucociliary epithelium with similarities to the epithelia of mammalian airways. This epithelium plays an essential, early role in planarian regeneration as the cells surrounding the wound site must quickly stretch and extend to cover the wound area after injury. We hypothesized that these injury-induced morphological changes activate the transcription of genes with essential functions in the regenerative process. To best detect these transcriptional changes, we developed a rapid method for isolating the planarian outer epithelium and prepared ribodepleted RNA-sequencing libraries from samples isolated at multiple time points after tissue amputation. One gene we both identified using these methods and found to be functionally important for regeneration is a putative planarian homolog of vertebrate Shoc2. SHOC2 is an essential scaffolding protein that mediates specific, context-dependent activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (JANG AND GALPERIN 2016). Notably, the ERK1/2 pathway is known to be activated after injury and required for regeneration in multiple species (MANUEL et al. 2006; OWLARN et al. 2017; TOMASSO et al. 2023).

To address these challenges, we introduce scMODAL, a deep learning framework tailored for single-cell multi-omics data alignment using feature links. scMODAL integrates datasets with limited known positively correlated features, leveraging neural networks and generative adversarial networks to align cell embeddings and preserve feature topology.

However, their performance can vary depending on molecular and clinical contexts, complicating variant classification. Aim: This study aims to assess the performance variability of commonly used VEP tools under different conditions. Additionally, the study aims to recalibrate score thresholds to better reflect evidence of pathogenicity. Methods: ClinVar variants classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), benign (B), or likely benign (LB) were analyzed using 25 VEP tools. Tools were evaluated based on discriminatory performance. Data were stratified by variant creation date, allele frequency, conservation level, mode of inheritance (MOI), and disease category. For each subset, Bayesian methods were employed to recalibrate score thresholds corresponding to the levels of evidence defined by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Results: The performance of VEP tools varied significantly across different subsets. Variants created after 2020 showed a mild yet significant decrease in the performance of certain VEP tools, particularly those trained on earlier datasets. VEP tools exhibited reduced accuracy for variants with higher allele frequencies, particularly those exceeding a frequency of 10-4, suggesting a need for recalibration when assessing more common variants. Tools demonstrated lower discriminatory performance for variants located in regions with high conservation, mostly due to a decrease in specificity. Variants affecting autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked (XL) genes were more accurately classified compared to those affecting autosomal dominant (AD) genes by most tools. Differences in MOI and conservation levels within certain disease categories were shown to correlate with overall performance. Recalibration of prediction scores resulted in lower score thresholds in low conservation regions compared to high and uncovered subsets in which higher levels of evidence may be achieved.

Furthermore, it exhibits significant health disparities that affect African-American (AA) men more adversely than others do. Previously, we established CYP3A5, a highly expressed protein in AAs PC, as a positive regulator of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. We examined the impact of CYP3A5 depletion on genome-wide transcriptional output using RNA sequencing to gain deeper mechanistic insights. The data revealed that 561 genes were downregulated and 263 were upregulated upon silencing of CYP3A5 in PC cells. Furthermore, in silico pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes suggested that the cell cycle regulation pathway was most significantly affected by CYP3A5 inhibition. Cell cycle analysis of CYP3A5-silenced cells and those treated with clobetasol, a specific CYP3A5 pharmacological inhibitor, showed G1/S phase blockade. Both CYP3A5-depletion and pharmacological inhibition resulted in the downregulation of cyclin D, cyclin B, and CDK2, along with the upregulation of p27kip1 but had minimal effects on CDK4/6 levels. Combination treatment with clobetasol and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib exhibited synergy with combination index (CI) values ranging from 0.28-0.78. Our findings support the utility of CYP3A5 as a druggable therapeutic target that works more effectively in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition to limit the progression of PC, especially for AA patients with AA.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have demonstrated an important role for BRCA-mutant patients with early TNBC. Combination approaches with PARPi can broaden the use of PARPi to a larger cohort of TNBC patients. We selected six genes from our previously identified 63-gene signature that was associated with PARPi response. siFEN1 increased cells in G2/M arrest, DNA damage and particularly apoptosis. Targeting FEN1 with a chemical inhibitor enhanced the efficacy of PARPi in 7/10 cell lines, and synergy was demonstrated mainly in PARPi-resistant TNBC cell lines. A BRCA2-mutant cell line with acquired resistance to olaparib (HCC1395-OlaR) was strongly synergistic, with a combination index value of 0.20. The combination of PARPi and FEN1 inhibition also showed synergy in a PARPi-resistant xenograft-derived organoid model. Two mechanisms which explain the underlying efficacy are rapid progression in DNA replication fork speed and enhancement of DNA damage. The combination induced the highest fork speed (47% difference in comparison to control, P<0.0001) when FEN1 inhibition and PARPi equally increased fork speed individually in a cell line with a pre-existing increase in replication stress. The combination also increased DNA damage at lower drug concentrations, driving response in most of the synergistic cell lines. Gene expression analysis suggested that the sensitizing role of FEN1 inhibition in PARPi-resistant cell lines may be due to downregulation of pathways including mismatch repair.

While Ca2+ sensitization explains diastolic dysfunction, the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias remains unresolved. Here, we show that HCM mutations or pharmacological interventions that increase myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity generate bioenergetic mismatch and oxidative stress during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation, which provide a trigger and a substrate for arrhythmias. For any given sarcomere shortening that produces work and consumes ATP, less Ca2+ stimulates the Krebs cycle to maintain mitochondrial NADH. This reverses the mitochondrial transhydrogenase to regenerate NADH from NADPH, supporting ATP production at the cost of NADPH-dependent antioxidative capacity. The ensuing overflow of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria and glutathione oxidation induce spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ waves, well-defined triggers of arrhythmias. Furthermore, transhydrogenase-dependent ROS formation slows electrical conduction during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation in vivo, providing a substrate for arrhythmias. Chronic treatment with a mitochondrially-targeted ROS scavenger abolishes the arrhythmic burden during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation in HCM mice in vivo, while inducing mitochondrial ROS with a redox cycler is sufficient to induce arrhythmias in wild-type animals.

Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi, where they ensure the co-expression of enzymes and transcriptional regulators that coordinate the biosynthesis of specialised metabolites. Here, we report on a newly identified withanolide BGC in Physalis grisea (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolic analyses, revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed sub-clusters, containing eight pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this sub-functionalisation is tightly associated with with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two sub-clusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the chromatin structural level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression exclusively in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomic analysis, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the Solanaceae family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific sub-functionalisation is common to species of the Physalideae tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on the first instance of an epigenetically modulated sub-functionalisation within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids that play a role in plant defence and are amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and anti-cancer properties.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616232", "title": "Proline-2'-deoxymugineic acid (PDMA) increases seed quality and yield by alleviating iron deficiency symptoms in soybean under calcareous-alkaline conditions", "authors": "Kaya, Z.; Maqbool, A.; Suzuki, M.; Aksoy, E.", "author_corresponding": "Emre Aksoy", "author_corresponding_institution": "Middle East Technical University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "plant biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616232.source.xml", "abstract": "Iron (Fe) deficiency in crops, particularly in calcareous-alkaline soils, poses a major challenge due to Fe immobilization.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PDMA on soybean growth and yield under calcareous-alkaline conditions. A pot trial demonstrated that PDMA improves Fe uptake, translocation, and storage in soybeans, leading to increased chlorophyll content, and enhanced root and shoot growth.

Yet, this requires estimating the phase of a rhythm at the edge of the epoch. This is challenging, because any phase estimation that is spectrally specific requires a finite window length often combined with tapers that de-emphasize the signal close to the edge. To overcome this, we propose a method that builds on previously described approaches based on autoregressive modeling of the data and corresponding extrapolation beyond the edge. In contrast to related previous approaches, the modeling is based on the broadband signals, avoiding filtering-related group delays, and the extrapolation is performed multiple times, allowing averaging and thereby the reduction of extrapolation noise. The new method provided more accurate phase estimation at the edge for most simulated datasets, and for an empirical dataset from awake macaque area V4.

Preclinical studies suggest that hormones, particularly estrogens, are key to differential sensitivity, as female neurons demonstrate enhanced resilience compared to males in both in vivo and in vitro models. This study investigates whether these sex-specific differences in neuronal vulnerability extend to the ischemic penumbra and explores the effects of estrogens under such conditions. Methods: Primary cortical neuronal networks were generated from male and female newborn Wistar rats and cultured on micro-electrode arrays or glass coverslips. Male and female networks were subjected to hypoxic conditions, followed by a recovery phase, with or without exogenous estrogen treatment. Electrophysiological activity, including spikes and bursts, was monitored and analyzed. Apoptosis was assessed through immunocytochemistry, focusing on caspase-dependent and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-dependent pathways. Results: Under hypoxic conditions, male and female neuronal networks exhibited a similar decrease in firing and network burst rates, with an associated increase in network burst durations. Estrogen treatment altered these dynamics, leading to increased network burst rates and decreased network burst duration for both sexes. During recovery, no significant differences were observed between estrogen-treated and untreated networks. Immunocytochemistry revealed that estrogen significantly influenced caspase-dependent apoptosis, and to a lesser extent AIF-dependent apoptosis. Conclusions: In our model of the ischemic penumbra, sex-dependent differences in neuronal responses to hypoxic injury are primarily driven by estrogen, rather than intrinsic neuronal characteristics.

Unfortunately, poor compliance hinders the success of this approach. A proposed alternative is resveratrol (Rsv), a CR-mimetic known to promote brain health. Direct comparison between the effects of Rsv and CR on brain health is lacking, with limited knowledge on their sex-specific effects. Therefore, we aimed to compare and unravel the sex-specific impact of these dietary interventions on spontaneous brain activity. Methods: Here, we used resting-state fMRI to investigate functional connectivity (FC) changes in five prominent resting-state brain networks (RSNs) in healthy four month old male and female F344 rats supplemented to either 40% CR or daily Rsv supplementation (10 mg/kg, oral) for the duration of one month. Results: Our results demonstrated a decreased body weight (BW) in CR rats, as well as an increase in body weight in male Rsv supplemented rats, compared to female Rsv supplemented rats, whereas this difference between sexes was not observed in the control or CR groups. Furthermore, we found that both CR or Rsv supplementation induce a female-specific decrease of FC between the subcortical network and hippocampal network, and between the subcortical network and lateral cortical network. Moreover, Rsv supplementation lowered FC within the hippocampal network and between the hippocampal and the default mode like network, the lateral cortical network and the sensory network - an effect not observed for the CR rats. Finally, we observed an overall lower FC in male rats compared to females, irrespective of dietary intervention, within the subcortical network and between the subcortical, the sensory and default mode like network. Discussion: Our findings reveal that both CR and Rsv induce a similar female-specific decrease of FC in RSNs associated with memory and emotion, all the while CR and Rsv induce dissimilar changes in body weight and other within- and between RSN FC measures. Altogether, this study provides insight into the effects and comparability of short-term CR and Rsv supplementation on brain connectivity within and between RSNs in both male and female F344 rats, providing a FC reference for future research of dietary effects.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616293", "title": "Immunotherapy with nebulized pattern recognition receptor agonists restores severe immune paralysis and improves outcomes in mice with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis", "authors": "Garcia, J.

Given the high mortality of IAPA, adjunct immunomodulatory strategies remain a critical unmet need. Previously, desensitization of pattern recognition pathways has been described as a hallmark of IAPA pathogenesis and predictor of mortality in IAPA patients. Therefore, we studied the impact of nebulized Toll-like receptor 2/6/9 agonists Pam2 CSK4 (Pam2) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) on infection outcomes and pulmonary immunopathology in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed murine IAPA model. Mice with IAPA receiving mock therapy showed rapidly progressing disease and a paralyzed immune response to secondary A. fumigatus infection. Nebulized Pam2ODN was well tolerated and significantly prolonged event-free survival. Specifically, dual-dose Pam2ODN therapy before and after A. fumigatus infection led to 81% survival and full recovery of all survivors. Additionally, transcriptional analysis of lung tissue homogenates revealed induction of PRR signaling and several key effector cytokine pathways after Pam2ODN therapy. Moreover, transcriptional and flow cytometric analyses suggested enhanced recruitment of macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells in Pam2ODN-treated mice. Collectively, immunomodulatory treatment with nebulized Pam2ODN strongly improved morbidity and mortality outcomes and alleviated paralyzed antifungal immunity in an otherwise lethal IAPA model.

Robust tissue size control implies the existence of compensatory mechanisms that allow developing systems to recover from growth perturbations. However, the difficulty of directly observing normal or compensatory developmental growth means we have little understanding of the cellular behaviours that confer robustness to tissue size control. Here, we study how growth perturbations affect proliferation kinetics and the timing of growth termination of Drosophila histoblasts, the progenitors that give rise to the adult abdominal epidermis. Histoblasts undergo extensive growth and proliferation during the pupal stage, which is accessible for long-term live-imaging and precise quantitative analysis. By manipulating cell number or volume prior to the pupal growth phase, we changed the starting size of the abdomen primordium, then observed how the histoblasts adapted to these changes by altering their growth dynamics. We show that, upon a decrease in starting tissue size, the histoblasts compensate by extending their temporal proliferative window, undergoing additional cell cycles, as well as increasing their apical area to maximise coverage of the abdominal surface. When initial tissue size is increased, the histoblasts undergo fewer division cycles and arrest proliferation earlier than normal. Thus, the proliferative window of this tissue is flexible enough to buffer for changes in tissue size. Our data also suggest that the histoblasts sense both spatial and temporal cues to arrest their growth at the appropriate time and ensure accurate tissue size control.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616385", "title": "Tissue-specific transcriptomics uncovers novel craniofacial genes underlying jaw divergence in specialist pupfishes", "authors": "Palominos, M.

As indicated by the ecological modelling, the interplay of dispersal limitation and hetero selection might have contributed to such species divergence, while selective pressure from the harsh environment on the stone surface promoted functional convergence.

All host and virus isolates were obtained from tropical waters of the North Pacific, a first for viruses infecting green algae in the order Mamiellales. Genome length of the new isolates ranges from 205-212 kb, and phylogenetic analysis shows that all four are members of the genus Prasinovirus. Three of the viruses form a clade that is adjacent to previously sequenced Micromonas viruses, while the fourth virus is relatively divergent from previously sequenced prasinoviruses. We identified 61 putative genes not previously found in prasinoviruses, including a phosphate transporter from a family novel to viruses, and a potential apoptosis inhibitor novel to marine viruses. Forty-eight genes in the new viruses are also found in host genome(s) and may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. By analyzing the coding sequences of all published prasinoviruses we found that ~25% of prasinovirus gene content is significantly correlated with host genus identity (i.e., Micromonas, Ostreococcus, or Bathycoccus), and the functions of these genes suggest that much of the viral life cycle is differentially adapted to the three host genera.

Finally, we found that a few genes were differentially expressed but many more were differentially spliced between male and female naive brains, and between naive and pheromone blend-exposed brains. These are primarily calcium-binding channels and RNA-binding genes, respectively. A learned preference for changed levels in a single pheromone component was linked to variants of proteins involved in synaptic transmission. Our work shows that naive male and female brains differ primarily in gene splicing patterns and that a brief 3-minute exposure to pheromones produces slight changes in brain volume and large changes in the splicing of genes involved in neural development, that correlate with changes in sexual preferences in females.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616310", "title": "Divergent changes in social stress-induced motivation in male and female mice", "authors": "McGraw, M.; Christensen, C.; Nelson, H.; Li, A.-J.; Qualls-Creekmore, E.", "author_corresponding": "Emily Qualls-Creekmore", "author_corresponding_institution": "Washington State University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "animal behavior and cognition", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616310.source.xml", "abstract": "Exposure to stressors has been shown to dysregulate motivated behaviors in a bidirectional manner over time. The relationship between stress and motivation is relevant to psychological disorders, including depression, binge eating, and substance abuse; however, this relationship is not well characterized, especially in females, despite their increased risk of these disorders. Social defeat stress is a common model to study stress-induced motivation changes, however, historically this model excluded females due to lack of female-to-female aggression and unreliable male-to-female aggression. Additionally, changes in motivation are often assessed well after stress exposure ends, potentially missing or occluding changes to motivation during stress. Recently, the chronic non-discriminatory social defeat stress (CNSDS) model has demonstrated social defeat of male and female C57BL/6J mice by exposing both mice to an aggressive male CD-1 mouse simultaneously. Here we use this model to directly compare changes in the motivated behavior of male and female mice during and following chronic stress. We hypothesized that motivated behavioral responses would be dysregulated during stress and that the effects would worsen as the stress exposure continued. To monitor motivated behavior, mice had access to a Feeding Experimental Device.3 (FED3), a home cage device for operant responding. Operant responding was monitored prior to, during, and after stress by measuring nose pokes for sucrose pellets on a modified progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Our results demonstrated divergent behavioral outcomes between males and female mice in response to stress; where male mice increased motivated behavior during stress only, whereas female mice exhibited a decrease in motivation during and after stress. This study highlights the need to investigate the effects of stress-induced motivation over time, as well as the increased need to understand differences in the stress response in females.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.611680", "title": "PIRATE: Plundering AlphaFold Predictions to Automate Protein Engineering", "authors": "Richardson, G.; Kopec, J.; Esposito, C.; James, T.", "author_corresponding": "Graham Richardson", "author_corresponding_institution": "Evotec US, 303 B College Road East, Princeton, N.J., U.S.A", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "biochemistry", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.611680.source.xml", "abstract": "An important characteristic for many proteins is the presence of flexible loops or linkers known as intrinsically disordered regions.

The need for tunable and consistent media has thus encouraged development of chemically defined media (CDM).

Standard practice often neglects high-level interactions of media components, such as growth factors, that are critical to MSC growth and function.

However, the impact of data curation on ML model performance is underexplored. As more sequence and structural data become available, a data-centric approach is increasingly favored over a model-centric method. A data-centric approach prioritizes high-quality, domain-specific data, ensuring ML tools are trained on datasets that accurately reflect biological complexity and diversity. This paper introduces a novel methodology that integrates ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) into ML models, enhancing data-centric strategies in the field. ASR uses computational techniques to infer ancient protein sequences from modern descendants, providing diverse, stable sequences with rich evolutionary information. While multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are commonly used in protein engineering frameworks to incorporate evolutionary information, ASR offers deeper insights into protein evolution. Unlike MSAs, ASR captures mutation rates, phylogenic relationships, evolutionary trajectories, and specific ancestral sequences, giving access to novel protein sequences beyond what is available in public databases by natural selection. We employed two statistical methods for ASR: joint Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood. Bayesian approaches infer ancestral sequences by sampling from the entire posterior distribution, accounting for epistatic interactions between multiple amino acid positions to capture the nuances and uncertainties of ancestral sequences. In contrast, maximum likelihood methods estimate the most probable amino acids at individual positions in isolation. Both methods provide extensive ancestral data, enhancing ML model performance in protein sequence generation and fitness prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that generative ML models training on either Bayesian or maximum likelihood approaches produce highly stable and diverse protein sequences. We also fine-tuned the evolutionary scale ESM protein language model with reconstructed ancestral data to obtain evolutionary-driven protein representations, and downstream stability prediction tasks for Endolysin and Lysozyme C families. For Lysozyme C, ancestral-based representations outperformed the baseline ESM in KNN classification and matched the established InterPro method. In Endolysin, our novel ASR-Dist method performed on par with or better than the baseline and other fine-tuning approaches across various classification metrics. ASR-Dist showed consistent performance in both simple and complex classification models, suggesting the effectiveness of this data-centric approach in enhancing protein representations.

The 2DTM p-value combines information from two previously used 2DTM metrics, namely the 2DTM signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and z-score, which are derived from the cross-correlation coefficient between the target and the template. The 2DTM p-value demonstrates robust detection accuracies under various imaging and sample conditions and outperforms the 2DTM SNR and z-score alone.

Although structural studies of NaVs8,9 and anuran soluble STX binding proteins known as saxiphilins (Sxphs)10,11 revealed convergent binding modes for the bis guanidinium STX core10,11, the structural basis for STX congener recognition is unknown. Here, we show that American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) RcSxph10,11 and High Himalaya frog (Nanorana parkeri) NpSxph10 use a pre-organized pocket to sequester STX congeners through a binding mode shared with STX. This 'lock and key' recognition yields a tradeoff between a relatively rigid high affinity toxin binding site in which bound waters are crucial and the ability of Sxphs to accommodate STX congener modifications. Importantly, functional studies show that Sxphs act as 'toxin sponges' that reverse NaV block by multiple STX congeners and can detect these bis-guanidinium toxins in a radioligand receptor binding assay (RBA) for PSP toxin environmental testing12,13. Our findings establish how Sxphs sequester diverse neurotoxins and reveal structural factors underlying STX congener binding differences between Sxphs and NaVs that are rooted in the distinct toxin binding orientations on these two targets.

This study was formed to develop a proof of concept measurement system that could be used to quaantify local plant biomechanical pressures during growth in in-situ assays. Using micro cone penetrometer root analogues, we tested the viability of combining X-ray computed tomography (XCT) with X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in order to understand whether we can characterize the mechanics during penetration associated with root growth. Cone penetrometers were used to penetrate into surrogate soil materials (e.g. gypsum), as these materials have porous and granular behaviour similar to natural soils but facilitate diffraction measurements due to their well defined atomic structures. Diffraction maps were generated across a sub region of the imaged space in order to quantify changes in the diffraction patterns. Diffraction maps are simplified representations by spectra peaks resulting from integrated Debeye-Scherrerr rings. Shifts in the spectra peaks are associated with deformations of the lattice crystals that comprise the surrogate soil material resulting from applied loads from the micro cone penetrometers. XCT images highlight compaction zones near the cone tip during penetration, with an increase in the compression zones radius as we push the cone deeper into the media. The XRD measurements peak shifts just outside of the local compacted zone of the cone. Qualitative finite element simulations illustrate that this is likely due to local inelastic deformations near the cone tip during penetration. However, the remote elastic deformations can be monitored as long as the inelastic zone remains local to the cone tip. While direct measurements near a root tip might be difficult due to the inelastic nature of the penetration process, the results show promise in terms of gaining insights into the locality of root growth biomechanical processes and the potential to elucidate root strategies under compacted soils in an in-situ test.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616316", "title": "Making Aptamers More Antibody-like: Targeting AXL in Vivo Using a Bottlebrush Polymer-Conjugated Aptamer", "authors": "Sun, T.; Lin, J.; Xue, C.; Wang, Y.; Chen, P.; Wei, Y.; Xu, G.; Sidonia, A.; Nenopoulos, C.; Tashkandi, H.; Zhang, K.", "author_corresponding": "Ke Zhang", "author_corresponding_institution": "Northeastern University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "cancer biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616316.source.xml", "abstract": "The overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is linked to acquired drug resistance in cancer treatments.

In the context of non-persistently transmitted viruses, an important strategy is to change metabolism of the plant to attract the vectors, and subsequently repel viruliferous insects from the infected plants to facilitate the virus transmission to neighbouring plants. The presence of satellite RNAs (satRNAs), which accompany certain plant RNA virus species and strains, leads to changes in the host plants, such as alterations in the virus-induced infection symptoms, either exacerbating or attenuating them. This study aimed to analyse the influence of satRNAs on the orientation and feeding behaviour of the cucumovirus insect vector, Myzus persicae, which might consequently contribute to the virus transmission efficiency. The hypothesis behind this study was that satRNAs of cucumoviruses alter these insect activities toward virus-infected plants, and strongly symptom-deteriorating satRNAs might negatively affect the attractiveness of the infected plants for aphids. Using two cucumoviruses, peanut stunt virus (PSV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and their satRNAs, which induce divergent infection symptoms, olfactometry and electrical penetration graph (EPG) monitoring analyses were performed. The results showed that satRNAs which presence leads to disease symptom exacerbation might alter the orientation behaviour of aphids by reducing the attractiveness of the plants and discouraging aphids from feeding. This phenomenon may contribute to the better persistence in the environment of satRNAs alleviating disease symptoms compared to the worsening ones, benefiting the virus by not destroying the plant and prolonging exposure of the virus to insect vectors.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616320", "title": "Onco-fetal protein Nogo-A restricts human and mouse glioma vascularization and growth via VEGF-Notch-hippo-metabolic signaling", "authors": "Schwab, M.; Ghobrial, M.; Macias, J.

Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is highly dynamic during brain development, enters a mostly quiescent state in the adult homeostatic brain, and is reactivated in vascular-dependent CNS diseases including brain tumors. In consequence, a better understanding of the relevance of the onco-fetal axis - describing the reactivation of fetal signaling programs in tumors - in endothelial- and perivascular cells of the human brain tumor vasculature harbors great translational potential, yet remains poorly defined. In development, neurovascular link (NVL) molecules guide both neuronal growth cones as well as capillary endothelial tip cells. Nogo-A is an NVL molecule known to inhibit axonal growth in the developing and adult CNS and to restrict angiogenesis during brain development, but its role in the mouse and human brain tumor vasculature along the onco-fetal axis remains unknown. Here, we characterize Nogo-A as an onco-fetal protein expressed in the neurovascular unit (NVU) in human fetal brains and human gliomas in vivo that negatively regulates sprouting angiogenesis and endothelial tip cells in glioma vascularization. The Nogo-A-specific Delta 20 domain restricts angiogenic sprouting and branching and promotes vascular normalization while inhibiting glioma growth in experimental gliomas. Moreover, Nogo-A expression in tumor cells negatively correlate/s with glioma malignancy in vivo. In vitro, Nogo-A Delta 20 reduced human brain- and brain tumor endothelial cell (HBMVEC, HBTMVEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) spreading, migration, and sprouting, in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited filopodia extension glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing of Nogo-A Delta 20-treated HBMVECs and HBTMVECs revealed Nogo-A Delta 20-induced positive regulation of the angiogenesis-inhibiting Dll4-Notch-pathway and inhibition of the angiogenesis-promoting VEGF-VEGFR and Hippo-YAP-TAZ pathways, whereas metabolomics and functional metabolic assays revealed Nogo-A Delta 20-induced negative regulation of endothelial glycolysis in HBMVECs and HBTMVECs. These findings characterize Nogo-A as an onco-fetal protein in the human glial brain tumor vasculature and identify Nogo-A Delta 20 signaling as an important negative regulator of human glioma vascularization and growth. Enhancing Nogo-A signaling may be an attractive alternative or combinatorial anti-angiogenic therapy to restrict human glioma/glioblastoma vascularization and growth.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616364", "title": "Motor Imagery Improves Force Control in Older and Young Females", "authors": "Calkins, C.

The purpose of this study was to determine if one session of MIT influences corticospinal excitability and improves FS of isometric elbow flexion contractions in young and older female adults. To test the hypotheses that MIT would increase corticospinal excitability and improve isometric elbow flexion FS to a greater extent in older compared to young females fourteen older (67-89 years old) and twenty-two younger (19-33 years old) participants were randomly assigned to a MIT group or Control group.

Here, we present a draft report describing Chemopleth 1.0, a chemoarchitecture database for the rat hypothalamus (HY) and zona incerta (ZI), which will eventually feature downloadable interactive maps featuring the census distributions of five immunoreactive neurochemical systems: (1) vasopressin (as detected using its gene co-product, copeptin); (2) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.13.39); (3) hypocretin 1/orexin A; (4) melanin-concentrating hormone; and (5) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. These maps are formatted for the widely used Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) open-access rat brain atlas. Importantly, this dataset retains atlas stereotaxic coordinates that facilitate the precise targeting of the cell bodies and/or axonal fibers of these neurochemical systems, thereby potentially serving to streamline delivery of viral vectors for gene-directed manipulations. The maps will be presented together with novel open-access tools to visualize the data, including a new Python programming language-based workflow to quantify cell positions and fiber densities for BM4.0. The workflow produces heat maps of neurochemical distributions from multiple subjects: 1) isopleth maps that represent consensus distributions independent of underlying atlas boundary conditions, and 2) choropleth maps that provide distribution differences based on cytoarchitectonic boundaries. These multi-subject cartographic representations are produced in Python from exported atlas maps first generated in the Adobe(R) Illustrator(R) vector graphics environment, which are then reimported and placed directly into the BM4.0 atlas.

This work reports a scalable approach to build neuron connection networks of mouse brains by mapping whole-brain single-neuron connectivity using two complementary methods at sub-neuronal levels. We first generated an arbor-net by partitioning and probabilistically pairing dendritic and axonal arbors of 20,247 neurons registered to the Allen Brain Atlas.

Our cross-validation of both the arbor-net and bouton-net showed statistical consistency in the spatially and anatomically modular distributions of neuronal connections, which also corresponded to functional modules of the mouse brain. Our single-neuron connections were also validated by two existing independent connectomes of coarser resolution based on viral tracing of neuron populations and barcoding-and-sequencing, as well as an independent synaptome containing the relative density distribution of synapses. We further found that single neuronal connections correlated more strongly with gene co-expression at both the brain region and single-cell levels than the previous full-brain mesoscale connectome of a mouse brain. Our findings allow the assembly of a new whole-brain scale single-neuron resolution connectome for all brain regions, called SEU-net.

We find that certain hierarchies, such as the one seen in the human brain, impart ANN models with a light visual bias similar to that seen in humans while maintaining excellent performance on all audio-visual tasks. The results further suggest that different configurations of top-down feedback make otherwise identically connected models functionally distinct from each other and from traditional feedforward only recurrent models. Altogether our findings demonstrate that top-down feedback is a relevant feature of biological brains that improves the explanatory power of ANN models in computational neuroscience.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.615924", "title": "Multi-laboratory Study Establishes Reproducible Methods for Plant-Microbiome Research in Fabricated Ecosystems", "authors": "Novak, V.; Andeer, P.

We analyzed kidney transcriptomes from 34 species to quantify and characterize convergent evolution at the level of gene expression, tissue composition, and coding sequences.

However, organisms can circumvent trade-offs in specific environmental contexts through phenotypic plasticity, though the mechanisms that drive trade-offs or allow organisms to resolve trade-offs are often cryptic. The trade-off between water loss and gas exchange poses a fundamental challenge for terrestrial life because the capacity to absorb oxygen is limited by the risk of desiccation from water loss across respiratory surfaces. Here, we investigated the capacity to mitigate this trade-off in a lungless salamander that breathes exclusively across its skin. We measured water loss and oxygen uptake using respirometry in field- and laboratory-based studies to identify plastic responses to environmental variation, coupled with gene expression analyses to investigate biological pathways that regulate the trade-off. Though the trade-off between oxygen uptake and water loss was generally strong, we observed that its strength changed over time in the field and laboratory. At the molecular level, we found support for antagonistic pleiotropy in multiple pathways that simultaneously affect both physiological traits (e.g., via vasoconstriction and downregulation of aerobic respiration), and for mechanisms that mitigate the trade-off by affecting only one trait (e.g., oxygen binding affinity, melanin synthesis). As organisms disentangle such conflicts, however, alternative trade-offs are likely to arise.

This inspired us to conduct a project at the NIH-funded 4D Nucleome Hackathon on March 18-21, 2024 at The University of Washington in Seattle, USA. The hackathon provided an amazing opportunity to gather an international, multi-institutional and unbiased group of experts to discuss, understand and undertake the challenges of chromatin model comparison and validation. These challenges seem straightforward in theory, however in practice, they are challenging and ambiguous. To address them, we developed a bioinformatics workflow for chromatin model comparison and validation, in which we use distance matrices to represent chromatin models, and we calculate Spearman correlation coefficients between pairs of matrices to estimate correlations between models, as well as between models and experimental data. During the 4-day hackathon, we tested our workflow on several distinct software packages for chromatin structure modeling and we discovered several challenges that include: 1) different aspects of chromatin biophysics and scales complicate model comparisons, 2) expertise in biology, bioinformatics, and physics is necessary to conduct a comprehensive research on chromatin structure, 3) bioinformatic software, which is often developed in academic settings, is characterized by insufficient support and documentation.

Human immune responses to infections caused by respiratory viruses are complex and dependent on the length of time the host has been infected. Human viral challenge studies provide a useful opportunity to understand the timing of human immune responses as samples can be obtained pre-inoculation and post-inoculation by defined virus inocula. Transcriptomic data is available from a large amount of publicly available viral challenge studies and genome-wide transcriptomic data is primarily derived from bulk samples containing mixed cell subpopulations. Traditional bulk transcriptomic analysis methods often utilize deconvolution techniques to study changes in cell proportions of major immune cell types. Methods and Principal Findings In this study, we digitally sorted the cellular diversity of 31 blood immune cell types over time in human challenge studies after inoculation by H3N2 influenza virus H1N1 influenza virus, and RSV using xCell, a digital cell separation method, on human bulk transcriptional repository data. We identified common inoculation-induced changes in cell subpopulations across studies of the three viruses with time kinetics. We observed a consistent elevation of myeloid cells and their subtypes post-inoculation across various viral inoculations. Lymphocytes and their subpopulations were reduced in symptomatic and infected (Sx/Inf) participants compared to asymptomatic and uninfected (Asx/Uninf) participants. H3N2 evoked the earliest transcriptional immune responses, followed by H1N1, RSV infection elicited a delayed transcriptional response compared to both influenza viruses likely due to slower replication kinetics. Our analysis also revealed unique immune cell composition changes caused by specific viruses. We found that pre-existing baseline memory T cells were associated with resistance to influenza viral infection and that the key cell type is effector memory (Tem) CD8 T cells. Conclusion These findings identify specific target cell subpopulations which respond to respiratory virus inoculation over time, shedding light on mechanisms for eliciting a robust baseline level of immune memory against multiple viral strains.

Spatial-scERA integrates massively parallel reporter assays coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial reconstruction using optimal transport, to map cell-type-specific enhancer activity at the single-cell level on a 3D virtual representation of the sample. We evaluated spatial-scERA in stage 6 Drosophila embryos using 25 candidate enhancers (including 19 previously uncharacterized regions), and validated the robustness of our predicted reconstructions by comparing them to microscopy images generated by in situ hybridization. Remarkably, spatial-scERA faithfully reconstructed the spatial activity of these enhancers, even when the enhancer-reporter construct was expressed in as few as 10 cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of integrating transcriptomic and spatial data for the accurate prediction of enhancer activity patterns in complex multicellular samples. Indeed, we found that chromatin modifications and open chromatin regions are often poor predictors of enhancer activity. Moreover, spatial data can often be essential for the accurate annotation of scRNA-seq clusters.

ULM maps brain-wide cerebral vasculature with high spatial resolution and identifies microvascular impairments around hemorrhagic areas. NDs are sub-micron liquid-core particles which can extravasate due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, serving as positive contrast agents to detect hemorrhage sites. Results: Our findings demonstrate that NDs could effectively accumulate in the hemorrhagic site and reveal the location of the bleeding areas upon activation by focused ultrasound beams.

A vector representation of a protein-compound pair based on a concatenation of the compound fingerprint and the protein triplet vector has been used to train random forest and neural network models on multiple datasets of protein-compound interaction together with compound associated transcription and activity profiles. Results for compound-target predictability are comparable with more complex published methodologies. Conclusion. A simple intuitive representation of a protein-compound pair can be employed in a variety of machine learning models to gain a predictive handle on the activity of compounds for which there is no activity data. It is hoped that this transparent approach will prove sufficiently portable and simple to implement that drug discovery will be opened up to the wider research community.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616274", "title": "Unlearning Virus Knowledge Toward Safe and Responsible Mutation Effect Predictions", "authors": "Li, M.; Zhou, B.; Tan, Y.; Hong, L.", "author_corresponding": "Mingchen Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "East China University of Science and Technology", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "bioinformatics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616274.source.xml", "abstract": "Pre-trained deep protein models have become essential tools in fields such as biomedical research, enzyme engineering, and therapeutics due to their ability to predict and optimize protein properties effectively.

These networks often exhibit characteristics of spatially-distributed excitable systems, with propagating waves of signaling activity that govern processes such as cell migration, division, and other essential physiological functions. Traditionally, these reaction-diffusion systems have been modeled using stochastic partial differential equations incorporating spatial Langevin-type dynamics. Although these knowledge-based models have provided valuable insights, they are typically not directly inferred from experimental data. In this study, we introduce and apply two data-driven methodologies for learning the structure and parameters of spatial Langevin equation (SLE) models: 1) Kramers-Moyal regression, an adaptation of an established approach to fit microscale stochastic dynamics, and 2) wave features optimization, a novel approach to match macroscale spatiotemporal patterns. Unlike black-box neural network models that predict system behavior but provide no mechanistic insight, this approach estimates nonlinear model equations that directly relate to system structure and dynamics. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on simulation datasets derived from two stochastic reaction-diffusion models: one based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations (FHN model) and another on a biochemically adapted version of the FHN equations (FR model). Our results demonstrate that optimizing stochastic dynamics and wave patterns enables the accurate estimation of SLE model structure and parameters directly from 1D and 2D spatial data. With sparsity enforcement, we also identify novel sparse reaction-diffusion models for excitable systems. We show that this approach effectively approximates system behavior even when working with datasets similar to experimental conditions, with low temporal resolution and unobserved molecular components.

The fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) has been studied extensively in the context of blood cell development and leukemia pathogenesis, but little is known about its role in the brain. Previous work characterizing FLT3 protein expression in the brain have not yielded convincing results, mainly limited by the low expression level of FLT3 and poor sensitivity of standard immunolabeling method using fluorescent secondary antibody. In this study, we report the systematic characterization of FLT3 protein localization during brain development using a highly sensitive immunolabeling methodology based on alkaline phosphatase (AP) polymer biochemistry. Our results reveal a previously unknown neuron-selective FLT3 expression pattern in both mouse and human cerebellum tissue samples, and demonstrate a gradual increase in the total FLT3 protein level and a cytosolic-to-dendritic change in subcellular FLT3 distribution during mouse cerebellum development. Through combining the AP immunolabeling of FLT3 with standard immunostaining of various cell type markers to achieve hybrid co-labeling of multiple antigens in tissue sections, we demonstrate that the main cell type that express FLT3 in the cerebellum is PV+, Calbindin+ Purkinje cells. To expand the use case of AP immunolabeling method in labeling neuronal proteins, we show robust labeling of Kir2.1, a potassium channel protein that is expressed at low level in neurons, in brain tissue sections collected from mouse, pig, and human brains. We further established that the AP immunolabeling method can be used in human stem cell-derived neurons to detect postsynaptic density scaffold protein PSD95 within fine subcellular structures such as dendritic spines and synapses, in cultured primary mouse cortical neurons and human stem cell-derived neurons. To our knowledge, our work represents the first report of applying AP immunolabeling to detect neuronal protein expression in brain tissue and cell samples.

While CAR-T cell therapy has proven effective for hematological malignancies, it faces challenges in treating solid tumors due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and physical barriers hindering CAR-T cell infiltration. NK cells, particularly adaptive NK (aNK) cells, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization and their resistance to immunosuppressive environments. Purpose: The study investigates the role of cytokines, specifically IL-21 and IL-15, in enhancing aNK cell expansion and activation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Methods: Buffy coats and GBM TILs were collected from Karolinska Hospital. NK cells were isolated and expanded in vitro with IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines and feeder cells (K562 and K562E). Furthermore, tumor lysate was added in the cultures to boost memory responses in aNK cells. NK cell functionality, cytotoxicity, and phenotyping was assessed using flow cytometry and statistical analysis (t-test and two-way ANOVA) used to validate the results. Further animal model was used to validate the cytotoxicity capacities of these cells against GBM tumors using a zebrafish model. Results: IL-21 drives the expansion of aNK better than IL-15 controls, data shown in PBMCs and TILs derived from GBM patients and IPLA OVCA patients. Additionally, the use of tumor lysate as a booster for restimulation further amplifies the cytotoxic capacity of aNK cells against autologous tumors. The zebrafish model validates this method, by decreasing the tumor size in zebrafish animals after 3 days of injection. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that IL-21 is essential for the specific expansion of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. Additionally, tumor lysate significantly increases the cytotoxic efficacy of aNK cells upon restimulation with the same tumor cells. These findings suggest that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the specific expansion and activation of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. By optimizing the expansion protocol, this method aims to advance the clinical application of aNK cells in immunotherapies for solid tumors, offering a potential solution to the limitations faced by current CAR-T therapies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616363", "title": "PPAR\u03b3 downregulation in colonic CD8+ T cells results in epithelial barrier disruption in people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy", "authors": "Das Adhikari, U.; Froehle, L.

Results: We found that Tfh and Tfr cells exhibit organ-specific phenotypes related to their activation status and IL-1 receptor expression.

In autoimmune patients, high IL-1{beta} and circulating Tfr levels correlated with higher autoantibody levels, linking inflammation, IL-1{beta} signaling, and the Tfr/Tfh balance.

In this study, we characterized these genes in nearly two hundred metagenomes collected from multiple sites in western Lake Erie at a five-year time interval: 2014-2019. 11 metal resistance genes (MRGs) and nine antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were characterized and demonstrated significant changes in diversity and spatial distribution.

Dosage compensation by DNAm would result in higher and more variable DNAm level in males relative to females on the Z chromosome. However, we found that the level of DNAm and its variance on the Z chromosome was lower in males. Moreover, male Z chromosome-based gene promoters were more frequently hypomethylated compared to females, indicating absence of upregulation on a gene-by-gene basis across the female Z chromosome. We suggest our findings reveal mitigation of an intra-genomic sexual conflict, with females suppressing expression of Z chromosome-based genes that benefit male but not female fitness. W was the most methylated chromosome, but hypermethylation on the W chromosome was mostly confined to intergenic regions, presumably resulting in the downregulation of transposable elements known to comprise a large part of the W chromosome.

We analysed 149 blood samples, including 71 from A. crecca and 78 from other species in the two families, collected from wetlands in the Kashmir region. Using four mitochondrial markers, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome b (Cyt b), 16S rRNA, and the control region,We evaluated the genetic diversity and lineage connectivity of these species. Our findings reveal that the mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of A. crecca in the Kashmir Himalayas are shared with European populations, indicating strong maternal gene flow and connectivity between distant populations. A minimum spanning haplotype network analysis showed minimal nucleotide differences among haplotypes, particularly in the Cyt b and control regions, suggesting low genetic differentiation and a high degree of similarity among individuals. Notably, we identified at least four distinct maternal lineages of A. crecca in the Kashmir wetlands, reflecting diverse migratory sources. Our results also highlight that DNA barcoding using COI exhibited both high and low species resolution, with significant intraspecific variation, making it a valuable tool for further phylogeographic studies.

Sequence features that enhance collagen stability have been deduced largely from studies of collagen-mimetic peptides, as the large sizes of collagens have precluded high-resolution studies of their structure. Thus, there is a need for new methods to analyze the structure and mechanics of native collagen proteins. In this study, we used AFM imaging to investigate the temperature response of collagen types I, III and particularly IV. We observed a time-dependent loss of folded structures upon exposure to body temperature, with structural destabilization along the collagenous domain reflected by a shorter overall contour length. We characterized the sequence-dependent bending stiffness profile of collagen IV as a function of temperature and identified a putative initiation site for thermally induced unfolding. Interchain disulfide bonds in collagen IV were shown to enhance thermal stability and serve as the primary nucleation sites for in vitro refolding. In contrast to the canonical C-to-N terminal folding direction, we found an interchain cystine knot to enable folding in the opposite direction. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that this cystine knot is evolutionarily conserved across metazoan phyla, highlighting its significance in the stabilization of early collagen IV structures.

Existing software tools, namely peak-callers, are available for analyzing data from these technologies, although they often struggle with diffuse and broad signals, such as those associated with broad histone post-translational modifications (PTMs). Results: To address this limitation, we present ChIPbinner, an open-source R package tailored for reference-agnostic analysis of broad PTMs. Instead of relying on pre-identified enriched regions from peak-callers, ChIPbinner divides (bins) the genome into uniform windows. Thus, users are provided with an unbiased method to explore genome-wide differences between two samples using scatterplots, principal component analysis (PCA), and correlation plots. It also facilitates the identification and characterization of differential clusters of bins, allowing users to focus on specific genomic regions significantly affected by treatments or mutations. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool through a case study assessing H3K36me2 depletion following NSD1 knockout in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting the advantages of ChIPbinner in detecting broad histone mark changes over existing software. Conclusions: Binned analysis provides a more holistic view of the genomic landscape, allowing researchers to uncover broader patterns and correlations that may be missed when solely focusing on individual peaks.

Pairwise combinations of oncogenically active forms of the terminal transcription factor effectors of these pathways, namely {beta}-catenin (B), YAP (Y) and NRF2 (N) generate HBs in mice, with the triple combination (B+Y+N) being particularly potent. Each tumor group alters the expression of thousands of B-,Y- and N-driven unique and common target genes. Identifying those most responsible for transformation is thus an important question as it might reveal new mechanistic insights and therapeutic opportunities. Approach and Results: Transcriptional profiling of >60 murine HBs driven by the above oncogenic combinations and different B mutants and in genetic backgrounds that impair tumor growth rates but not initiation has revealed a common set of 22 \"BYN genes\" that are similarly deregulated in all cases. Many are associated with multiple \"Cancer Hallmarks\" and their expression levels often correlate with survival in human HBs, hepatocellular carcinomas and other cancers. Among the most down-regulated of these is Gas1, which encodes a Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked outer membrane protein. We show here that restoring Gas1 expression impairs B+Y+N-driven HB tumor growth in vivo and in HB-derived immortalized cell lines in vitro in a manner than requires membrane anchoring of the protein via its GPI moiety.

In neurons, these channels are activated through a coordinated response to both signals; however, for BK channels to respond to physiological voltage changes, elevated concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ (ranging from 1 to 10 M) are necessary. As a result, it is believed that BK channels are typically localized within nanodomains near Ca2+ sources (approximately 20-50 nm), such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Since the first evidence of NMDAR-BK channel coupling reported by Isaacson and Murphy in 2001 in the olfactory bulb, further studies have identified functional coupling between NMDARs and BK channels in other regions of the brain, emphasizing their importance in neuronal function. Mutations in the genes encoding NMDAR subunits have been directly linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. For instance, mutations such as V15M and V618G in the GRIN2B gene, which encodes the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, are implicated in the pathogenesis of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE27). Here, we explored the effects of these two GluN2B mutations on NMDAR-BK channel coupling, employing a combination of electrophysiological, biochemical, and imaging techniques. Taken together, our results demonstrate that mutation V618G specifically disrupts NMDAR-BK complex formation, impairing functional coupling, in spite of robust individual channel expression in the membrane.

This study analyzed the molecular identity and genetic structure of 200 Z. tritici isolates retrieved from diseased crops in central and south-eastern regions of Ethiopia. Allelic diversity at 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci was examined for all 200 isolates, and 165 isolates were identified by Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear DNA (rDNA) region. The microsatellites were highly polymorphic, with mean number of alleles (Na) = 6.23, effective alleles (Ne) =2.90, Neis gene diversity (H) =0.57, and polymorphic information content (PIC) =0.59, and an analysis of molecular variance confirmed the presence of low population differentiation (Fixation Index (FST) = 0.02, Gene Flow (Nm) = 14.7), with 95% of the total genetic variation residing within populations, and only 5% residing between populations. The highest genetic diversity (Number of allele (Na) = 9.33, Effective number of allele (Ne) = 3.41 and Neis gene diversity (H) = 0.68) was observed in the Oromia special zone surrounding Finfinnee (OSZ) Z. tritici populations, followed by Arsi and North Shewa populations, indicating that these areas are ideal for multi-location germplasm resistance screening, and also pathogen genetic and genomic analyses. Cluster analyses did not clearly divide the populations into genetically separate clusters according to their geographic sampling areas, probably because of high gene flow. All individual samples showed genetic admixture, and shared genomic backgrounds from two subgroups (K=2). Overall, the SSR markers proved to be highly informative and effective genetic tools for unlocking the pathogens genetic structure. The Z. tritici populations of central and southeast Ethiopia exhibit high genetic diversity, indicating the need to deploy durable and diverse disease management strategies.

Here, we use the zebrafish and the scaffold protein Gephyrin (Gphn) as a tool to examine post-synaptic protein function in OLs with respect to myelinated axon class identity. We show that Gphn protein is enriched in myelin sheaths that wrap GABAergic and glycinergic axons. Using Gphn loss-of-function approaches, we found an accumulation of long myelin sheaths across development that specifically wrap GABAergic axons.

While the FLT3 signaling pathway has been extensively studied in blood cell development and leukemia, its role in the brain remains largely unexplored. Through our previous high-throughput drug screening work unexpectedly found that several small molecule FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i), including KW-2449 and Sunitinib, enhance expression of the gene encoding chloride transporter KCC2 in neurons. KCC2 is crucial for brain development and function, and its dysregulation is linked to many brain diseases. These findings suggest previously unrecognized roles of FLT3 signaling in brain health and disease that have yet to be systematically studied. In this study, we utilized a functional genomics approach to investigate the transcriptomic changes induced by pharmacological inhibition of the FLT3 pathway in brain cells, including cultured primary mouse neurons, a human stem cell-derived neuronal model of Rett syndrome (RTT), and human stem cell-derived microglia cultures. Our results show that treating human or mouse neurons with FLT3i drugs significantly upregulates genes crucial for brain development while downregulating genes linked to neuroinflammation. In contrast, FLT3i treatment of human microglia, which do not express FLT3, has no effect on their gene expression, highlighting the cell type-specific roles of FLT3 signaling in the brain. To further understand how FLT3 signaling regulates the expression of neuronal maturation genes such as KCC2, we conducted a curated CRISPR screen that identified a number of transcription factors involved in FLT3i-mediated KCC2 activation in neurons. The mRNA and protein levels of several neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes are significantly upregulated in FLT3i-treated neurons, indicating potential therapeutic applications of FLT3i in rescuing underexpression and/or haploinsufficiency of disease-associated genes. In our in vivo studies, we evaluated the efficacy of the FLT3i drug KW-2449 in mice, demonstrating that it can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, induce KCC2 protein expression for up to 24 hours after a single injection, and reduces seizure activity in a chemoconvulsant-induced mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unrecognized roles of neuron-specific FLT3 signaling in promoting neuronal maturation and reducing neuroinflammation.

Because this problem is, in general, not tractable, current approaches to the control of networks mostly consider simplified settings (e.g., variations of the Linear-Quadratic Regulator). Here, we present a mathematical framework for optimal control of recurrent networks of stochastic spiking neurons with low-rank connectivity. An essential ingredient is a control-cost that penalizes deviations from the default dynamics of the network (specified by its recurrent connections), which motivates the controller to use the default dynamics as much as possible. We derive a Bellman Equation that specifies a Value function over the low-dimensional network state (LDS), and a corresponding optimal control input. The optimal control law takes the form of a feedback controller that provides external excitatory (inhibitory) synaptic input to neurons in the recurrent network if their spiking activity tends to move the LDS towards regions of higher (lower) Value. We use our theory to study the problem of steering the state of the network towards particular terminal regions which can lie either in or out of regions in the LDS with slow dynamics, in analogy to standard BMI experiments.

However, the survival of these habitats and their biota is increasingly threatened by a combination of pressures from climate change and extractive processes, jeopardizing the long-term ecological functioning of these ecosystems. With the goal of improving conservation efforts through state-of-the-art survey techniques in hypersaline ecosystems, this study tests the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for metazoan biomonitoring. We employed a multi-assay approach utilizing three genetic markers (12S rRNA, 18S rRNA, and COI) to analyze biodiversity in two types of environmental substrates, sediment and water. These samples were collected from three hypersaline lakes situated at high altitude in Northern Chile: Salar de Atacama (Laguna Puilar), Salar de Pujsa, and Salar de Tara. In addition, we compared the eDNA outputs with results generated from aquatic macroinvertebrate assessments using kick-nets to evaluate the potential for complementary sampling approaches. Our eDNA analyses revealed a total of 21 and 22 taxa across the three hypersaline lakes in sediment and water, respectively. Within both substrates, the highest diversity was found in Salar de Tara (15 taxa within sediment and 13 taxa from water). Our multi-assay design was able to detect a range of resident hypersaline taxa with different conservation status, spanning from rotifers (Encentrum) to endangered snails (Heleobia atacamensis), to amphipods (Hyalella) and flamingos (Pheonicopterus). Macroinvertebrate presence/absence data derived from conventional kick-net surveys further validated Salar de Tara as the most biodiverse system.

Overall, this study provides evidence that eDNA is an effective tool to elucidate fine scale taxa assemblages and can refine conservation efforts in hypersaline lakes.

However, their adoption and increased clinical use in low resource settings (LRSs) is partly hindered by logistical factors including supplies required for pre-analytical sample handling and limited infrastructure. We aimed to determine the effects of altered sample processing conditions on stability of insulin and C-peptide at the pre-analytical stage. Methods: We investigated the stability of C-peptide and insulin in serum and plasma collected, preservative type, time to centrifugation, storage conditions and duration of storage on the stability of C-peptide and insulin over 24 hours. Results: Both C-peptide and insulin levels remained stable above 90% from baseline p=1.000 & p=0.776 over 24 hours for samples stored in K2EDTA tubes, whether at room temperature or in a cooler box, both as centrifuged and uncentrifuged whole blood. In contrast, samples collected in plain serum tubes kept at room temperature and uncentrifuged C-peptide and insulin levels decreased significantly to 51%, p=0.006 and 62%, p=0. 083 respectively, similarly insulin levels for centrifuged samples declined to 64%, p=0.083 All iced and centrifuged serum samples remained above 90% of baseline concentration. Conclusions: In resource limited settings where insulin and c-peptide tests are limited to central laboratories and highly dependent on sample referral systems, these tests can be reliably measured without the need for immediate centrifugation or processing from samples collected in whole blood K2EDTA tubes uncentrifuged kept at room temperature and processed within 24hours.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616402", "title": "Starch granule initiation doesnt require a starch synthase 4 isoform in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.", "authors": "COURSEAUX, A.; Deschamps, P.; Dauvillee, D.", "author_corresponding": "David Dauvillee", "author_corresponding_institution": "CNRS", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "biochemistry", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.616402.source.xml", "abstract": "The initiation of starch granule synthesis remains a relatively poorly understood phenomenon.

While invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is commonly used for severe cases, noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) offers a less intrusive alternative that reduces complications and can be applied in moderate cases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the global shortage of ventilators, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where limited access to life-saving equipment exacerbated the crisis. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a simplified, compartmental-based simulation model for NIMV. This model provides a practical and accessible tool for simulating respiratory system behavior under various ventilation modes, using the analogy between electrical circuits and lung physiology. By simulating key parameters such as airway resistance and lung compliance, the model allows clinicians and researchers to evaluate ventilator performance and optimize treatment strategies. Furthermore, the simulation offers a blueprint for developing cost-effective, easy- to-use NIMV systems that can be deployed in resource-constrained environments.

Considerable evidence implies altered processing of frustration about missed rewards, but few studies investigated the preceding and thus potentially predictive reward anticipation and initial delivery processing in children with AD. Methods: A total of 103 children aged 8 to 12 years (50 with AD and 53 without AD) were examined during a monetary reward anticipation task with event-related potential (ERP) components resolving reward anticipation (cue-CNV [Contingent Negative Variation]) and reward delivery phases (Reward Positivity and Feedback-Related Negativity). All components were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Regression analyses also evaluated the associations between those ERP components and dimensional AD symptoms. Results: Children with AD showed attenuated anticipatory reward processing compared to No-ADs. The CNV at fronto-central site (FCz) showed a significant group effect (No AD>AD, p=0.017). Post-hoc test showed that this group difference was stronger for the cue monetary condition (monetary cue: p=.007, d=0.56, verbal cue: p=.901, d=0.16), and that only the No AD group showed a significant difference between conditions (p<0.001). No significant effects were obtained for the delivery phase. Regression analysis showed that a reduced anticipatory CNV at FCz significantly explained AD symptoms, and that anger/irritability and anxiety/depressive symptoms predicted a reduced anticipatory CNV at FCz. Conclusion: This neurophysiological characterization of reward anticipation and delivery in children with AD demonstrates altered neural activity in AD during anticipation of reward rather than following the delivery (or omission) of the reward itself. Our results highlight that altered reward anticipation in AD can occur outside frustration-prone tasks or settings, and underline the important role of both anger/irritability and anxiety/depressive symptoms in the pathophysiology of AD for atypical reward anticipation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616370", "title": "Theta-gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation enhances motor skill acquisition in healthy young and older adults", "authors": "Gamage, N.

High-definition TG tACS (6 Hz theta, 75 Hz gamma) or sham tACS was applied over right M1 for 20 minutes during a ballistic left-thumb abduction motor training task performed in two experimental sessions. Motor skill acquisition was quantified as changes in movement acceleration during and up to 60 minutes after training. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess changes in M1 excitability with motor-evoked potentials (MEP) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) before and after training. We found that TG tACS increased motor skill acquisition compared with sham tACS in young and older adults (P < 0.001), with greater effects for young adults (P = 0.01). The improved motor performance with TG tACS lasted at least 60 minutes after training in both age groups. Motor training was accompanied by greater MEP amplitudes with TG tACS compared to sham tACS in young and older adults (P < 0.001), but SICI did not vary between tACS sessions (P = 0.40).

The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) gives rise to two major cortical interneuron (cIN) populations, marked by Somatostatin (Sst) and Parvalbumin (Pvalb), which develop on different timelines. The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains poorly understood. Pvalb-positive cINs are particularly important for regulating cortical circuits through strong perisomatic inhibition, yet they have been difficult to model in vitro. Here we investigated the role of the environment in shaping and maintaining Pvalb cINs. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into a variety of 2D and 3D co-culture models, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic systems with dissociated cells, organoids, organotypic cultures, and conditioned media. Across models, we observed distinct proportions of Sst- and Pvalb-positive cIN descendants. Strikingly, grafting MGE progenitors into 3D human, but not mouse, corticogenesis models led to efficient, non-autonomous differentiation of Pvalb-positive cINs. This differentiation was characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets. Furthermore, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive cINs, when grafted onto human cortical models, also upregulated Pvalb expression. These results reveal an unexpected level of fate plasticity in MGE-derived cINs, demonstrating that their identities can be dynamically shaped by the surrounding environment.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616338", "title": "Genderized Gut and Oral Microbiome Shifts: Uncovering Sex-Specific Dysbiosis in Pancreatic Cancer", "authors": "Khan, Z.

While differences in immune responses and tumor biology between sexes have been explored, the role of the microbiome in gender-specific PDAC progression is still unclear. Investigating these differences could offer crucial insights for personalized treatment strategies for males and females. Methods: This study reanalyzed oral and gut microbiome data from BioProject: PRJNA832909, comprising 191 samples from PDAC patients and healthy controls. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we examined gender-specific bacterial signatures. Alpha diversity (richness) and beta diversity (community composition) were analyzed. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa were identified via LEfSe, and gender-specific bacterial panels were validated using CombiROC. Results: Alpha diversity analysis revealed significant differences in microbial richness, particularly between male and female PDAC patients and their healthy controls. Beta diversity demonstrated distinct microbial shifts between the PDAC and control groups across genders. LEfSe identified several pathogenic bacteria contributing to gender-specific dysbiosis, including Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella. Shared and sex-specific bacterial species in PDAC were highlighted through Venn diagram analysis. CombiROC validated the predictive ability of these bacterial markers, with AUC values exceeding 0.90 for both sexes.

Goal: Develop and phenotype a chronic spontaneous PSC-IBD mouse model, emphasizing colitis, colonic dysplasia, hepatobiliary inflammation/ fibrosis and the functional roles of resident microbiota. Methods: We utilized germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free Mdr2/Il10 DKO, Il10-/- and Mdr2-/- mice to model PSC-IBD. We monitored colonic dysplasia progression, colitis kinetics and severity by lipocalin-2, cytokine measurement, and tissue evaluations of colon and liver. We manipulated the microbiome to assess its functional effects. Results: DKO mice exhibited age- and region-specific accelerated colitis and spontaneous colonic dysplasia progressing to high-grade invasive adenocarcinomas. Despite aggressive colonic inflammation, DKO mice showed reduced hepatic fibrosis, increased hepatic reparative macrophages, and matrix metalloproteinase activity compared to Mdr2-/- mice. GF DKO had heightened liver inflammation and mortality with absent colitis and colonic dysplasia, reversed with microbial reconstitution from DKO mice.

To address this gap, our laboratory developed a strategy that utilizes a fluorescently traceable, dominant-negative protein named TEADi. TEADi specifically blocks the nuclear interactions of TEAD with YAP1 and TAZ, enabling precise dissection of Hippo TEAD-dependent and independent effects on cell fate. In this study, we aimed to enhance TEADi effectiveness by altering post-transcriptional modification sites within its TEAD-binding domains (TBDs). We demonstrate that a D93E mutation in the YAP1 TBD significantly increases TEADi inhibitory capacity.

Structural differences in YAP1 and TAZ TBDs were also identified, which may contribute to the distinct binding of these proteins to TEAD.

We found that the mandible remains in place throughout the licking cycle, while the maxilla undergoes significant shape deformation, such that the distal portion of the upper bill bends upwards. We propose that bill bending is a key component of the drinking mechanism in hummingbirds, allowing the coordination of bill function (distal wringing and basal expansion) and tongue function (raking/squeegeeing) during intraoral transport. We present a fluid analysis that reveals a combination of pressure-driven (Poiseuille) and boundary-driven (Couette) flows, which have previously been thought to represent alternative drinking mechanisms.

Stamping cells in suspension onto imaging slides, STAMP supports single-modal (RNA or protein) and multimodal (RNA and protein) profiling and flexible, ultra-high-throughput formats. STAMP allows the analysis of a single or multiple samples within the same experiment, enhancing experimental flexibility, throughput and scale. We tested STAMP with diverse sample types, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dissociated cancer cells and differentiated embryonic stem cell cultures, as well as whole cells and nuclei. Combining RNA and protein profiling, we applied immuno-phenotyping of millions of blood cells simultaneously. We also used STAMP to identify ultra-rare cell populations, simulating clinical applications to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

Preventing future infectious outbreaks and developing efficient mitigation protocols can benefit from advanced computational modeling approaches. Here, we developed an agent-based modeling approach to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of an infection outbreak in a confined environment caused by a specific pathogen and to determine effective infection containment protocols. The approach integrates the 3D geographic information system of a confined environment, the behavior of the hosts, key biological parameters about the pathogen obtained from the experimental data, and the general mechanics of host-pathogen and pathogen-fomite interactions. To assess our approach, we applied it to the historical data of infectious outbreak caused by norovirus, H1N1 influenza A, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. As a result our model was able to accurately predict the number of infections per day, correctly identify the day when the CDC vessel sanitation protocol would be triggered, single out key biological parameters affecting the infection spread, and propose important changes to existing containment protocols, specific for different pathogens. This research not only contributes to our understanding of infection spread and containment in cruise ships but also offers insights applicable to other similar confined settings, such as nursing homes, schools, and hospitals.

However, little is known about the physiological basis for this function. Here we show that the thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We found that skin was the largest target in a mouse body for dietary fat delivery, and that dietary triglyceride was assimilated both by epidermis and by dermal white adipose tissue. Skin from mice calorie-restricted for 3 weeks did not take up circulating lipids and showed a highly depleted stratum corneum. Dietary triglyceride acyl groups persist in skin for weeks after feeding. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, we have implicated both keratinocytes and sebocytes in the altered lipids which correlate with thermal function. In response to high fat feeding, wax diesters and ceramides accumulate, and triglycerides become more saturated. In contrast, in response to the dramatic loss of adipose tissue that accompanies restriction of the branched chain amino acid isoleucine, skin becomes more heat-permeable, resisting changes induced by Western diet feeding, with a signature of depleted signaling lipids. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616225", "title": "Unveiling the role of miRNAs from MSC-EVs in neuroinflammation and behavioral impairments induced by chronic alcohol consumption", "authors": "Mellado, S.; Touahri, N.; Montagud-Romero, S.; Perpina-Clerigues, C.; Garcia-Garcia, F.; Moreno-Manzano, V.; Guerri, C.; Rodriguez-Arias, M.; Pascual, M.", "author_corresponding": "Maria Pascual", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Valencia", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.616225.source.xml", "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs) have emerged as a promising form of regenerative and immunomodulatory therapy; indeed, micro (mi)RNAs contained within MSC-EVs modulate target gene expression and impact disease-associated pathways.

A potential solution is brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which could allow them to voluntarily control external devices (e.g., robotic arm) by decoding brain activity to movement commands. In the past decade, deep-learning decoders have achieved state-of-the-art results in most BMI applications, ranging from speech production to finger control. However, the 'black-box' nature of deep-learning decoders could lead to unexpected behaviors, resulting in major safety concerns in real-world physical control scenarios. In these applications, explainable but lower-performing decoders, such as the Kalman filter (KF), remain the norm. In this study, we designed a BMI decoder based on KalmanNet, an extension of the KF that augments its operation with recurrent neural networks to compute the Kalman gain. This results in a varying \"trust\" that shifts between inputs and dynamics. We used this algorithm to predict finger movements from the brain activity of two monkeys. We compared KalmanNet results offline (pre-recorded data, n=13 days) and online (real-time predictions, n=5 days) with a simple KF and two recent deep-learning algorithms: tcFNN (non-ReFIT version) and LSTM. KalmanNet achieved comparable or better results than other deep learning models in offline and online modes, relying on the dynamical model for stopping while depending more on neural inputs for initiating movements. We further validated this mechanism by implementing a heteroscedastic KF that used the same strategy, and it also approached state-of-the-art performance while remaining in the explainable domain of standard KFs. However, we also see two downsides to KalmanNet. KalmanNet shares the limited generalization ability of existing deep-learning decoders, and its usage of the KF as an inductive bias limits its performance in the presence of unseen noise distributions. Despite this trade-off, our analysis successfully integrates traditional controls and modern deep-learning approaches to motivate high-performing yet still explainable BMI designs.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616089", "title": "A triple serine motif in the intracellular domains of sortilin-related receptors SorCS1-3 regulates neurotrophic activity", "authors": "Dalby, A.; Ollendorff, M.

They have emerged as key regulators of synaptic activity and neurotrophic signaling, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we report that the SorCS1-3 intracellular domains (ICDs) contain a conserved triple serine motif that potentially functions as a signaling switch to induce neurotrophic signaling in hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate that phosphorylation mimicking mutations of the SorCS1-3 triple serine motifs display neurotrophic activity independently of both their extracellular domains (ECDs) and BDNF, and that the substitution of serines to alanines renders neurons less responsive to BDNF. Hence, we develop triple serine motif-based cell-penetrating peptides that modulate downstream signaling kinases of the BDNF pathway, ultimately activating the transcription factor CREB. Taken together, we provide the first mechanistic insights into SorCS1-3 mediated neurotrophic signaling and use this knowledge to develop pharmacologically active modulators.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.614523", "title": "Dynamic Attentional Control Through Mixed Prefrontal Cortex Resources", "authors": "Di Bello, F.; Ceccarelli, F.; Messinger, A.; Genovesio, A.", "author_corresponding": "Aldo Genovesio", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universita del Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy.", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.614523.source.xml", "abstract": "Spatial attention can be either involuntarily drawn to salient, unexpected events (exogenous attention) or voluntarily directed (endogenous attention).

A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model, as previous attempts failed to identify a suitable host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans that is a causative agent of encephalitis. VA1 RNA levels peak in heart tissue at day 7 post-inoculation. The cardiotropism was observed in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds evidenced by high VA1 RNA loads in heart tissue of A/J, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, Balb/c, and J:ARC mice. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Intracellular viral capsid was present in tissue sections based on immunofluorescent staining and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA co-localizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by > 10-fold in heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we also tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in human cardiac microvascular and coronary artery endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells.

Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis.

Regardless of skeletal muscle fiber type in mice, age was associated with increased myofibrillar connectivity, with 24 months of age, as compared to 3 months, displaying more sarcomere branches.

Additionally, while the soleus myofibrils in an aged cohort had a higher cross-sectional area, a reduction was observed in the gastrocnemius muscles. Cardiac muscles displayed no changes in sarcomere connectivity from 3 months to 24 months, although myofibril circularity and cross-sectional area were increased during this time.

We also characterized in-silico mating-type (MAT) genes of P. pachyrhizi, in the predicted proteome of three isolates, to investigate the sexual compatibility system. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis in P. pachyrhizi inferred two distinct evolutionary lineages structured on a temporal scale, with lineage Pp1 grouping isolates obtained from 1972 to 1994, while more recently collected isolates formed a second lineage, Pp2. We found high levels of genetic diversity in lineage Pp1, whereas lineage Pp2 exhibited a strong clonal genetic structure, with a significant lower diversity. The widespread propagation of P. pachyrhizi clonal spores across soybean-growing regions likely explains the absence of a large-scale spatial genetic structure within each lineage.

Moreover, gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions can contribute to variation in phenotypes and, in turn, fitness. Nevertheless, understanding the impact of GxE interactions in wild systems remains challenging. In the last 500 years, house mice have invaded the Americas. Despite their short residence time, there is evidence of rapid climate adaptation, including shifts in body size and aspects of metabolism with latitude. Previous studies in this system have identified candidate genes for metabolic adaptation using selection scans, however, environmental variation in diet as well as GxE interactions affecting metabolism are likely important factors in shaping body mass variation in wild populations. Here, we investigate the role of the environment and GxE interactions in shaping adaptive phenotypic variation with an experimental manipulation of diet. Using new locally adapted inbred strains from North and South America, we evaluated response to a high-fat diet, finding that sex, strain, diet, and the interaction between strain and diet contribute significantly to variation in aspects of body size. We also found that transcriptional response to diet is largely strain-specific, indicating that GxE interactions affecting gene expression are pervasive. Next, we used crosses between strains from contrasting climates (New York x Brazil and New York x Florida) to characterize gene expression regulatory divergence on a standard breeder diet and on a high-fat diet. We found that gene regulatory divergence is often condition-specific, particularly for trans-acting changes.

Their complex olfactory system is believed to have evolved due to the expansion of a specialized olfactory subsystem and the associated clade of olfactory receptors. Specifically, ants exhibit specialized antennal hairs known as basiconic sensilla, whose neurons project to a distinctive cluster of numerous, small glomeruli in their antennal lobes. This adaptation is believed to be linked to their social lifestyle, enabling the detection of recognition cues like cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which are essential for nestmate recognition and maintaining colony cohesion. However, our understanding of the ant olfactory system remains incomplete, lacking evolutionary context and phylogenetic breadth, which leaves the complexity in their most recent common ancestor uncertain. We thus conducted a comparative study of neuroanatomical traits across the phylogeny of the Formicidae. Our findings reveal a common blueprint for the ant olfactory pathway, alongside lineage-specific adaptations. This highlights a dynamic evolution, particularly for the CHC-related subsystem. Ancestral trait reconstructions indicate that olfactory sophistication predates the most recent common ancestor of ants. Additionally, we found that the chemical complexity of species-specific recognition cues is associated with neuronal investment within the olfactory system. Lastly, behavioral experiments on anatomically divergent ant species show that, despite variation in neuroanatomical traits, ants consistently discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates. This suggests that the evolution of ants' olfactory system integrates sensory adaptations to diverse chemical environments, facilitating communication, a key to social behaviors.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616438", "title": "Evolution of the non-visual and visual opsin gene repertoire in ray-finned fishes", "authors": "Policarpo, M.; Fogg, L.

Here, we provide the most comprehensive study to date on the evolution of the opsin gene family in the largest class of vertebrate, fishes, with a particular focus on the understudied non visual opsins. Based on an in depth analysis of 535 high quality genomes, we document great variation in gene numbers in the different opsin gene subfamilies across ray finned fishes and show that visual opsins are more prone to duplications and losses than non visual opsins. We provide compelling evidence that visual and non visual opsins coevolve in ray finned fishes, both in terms of copy numbers and selective pressures acting on their coding sequences, probably in response to the different photic environments they inhabit. Species that live in dim light or all in the dark (such as in caves or the deep sea) convergently reduced their visual and non visual opsin gene repertoires, while polar species feature accelerated evolution in both. Fishes that rely on electroreception show a reduction in the number of visual and non visual opsin genes and accelerated evolution of the remaining genes.

Smaller populations are at greater risk of fragmentation, genetic isolation, and eventual inbreeding depression. As genetic load is expressed and adaptive potential is lost, risk of population extinction greatly increases. Genetic rescue, the controlled introduction of genetic variation, is a method used to potentially relieve such effects in small populations. However, without understanding how the characteristics of rescuers impact rescue attempts, in both the short- and long-term, interventions run the risk of being sub-optimal, or even counterproductive. Here, we use the Red Flour Beetle (Tribolium castaneum) to experimentally test the impact of rescuer sex, and sexual selection background, on population productivity. We record the impact of genetic rescue on population productivity in 24/36 replicated populations for ten generations following intervention. We find little or no impact of rescuer sex on the efficacy of rescue (P = 0.926) but show that a background of elevated sexual selection makes individuals more effective rescuers (P = 0.024). Importantly, in both experiments, rescue effects on productivity diminish 6-10 generations after the rescue event. Our results confirm that the efficacy of genetic rescue can be influenced by characteristics of the rescuers and, for the first time, that the level of sexual selection in the rescuing population is an important factor. We show that any increase in fitness associated with rescue may only last for a limited number of generations, suggesting implications for conservation policy and practice.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.615948", "title": "Sex and genetic background influence intravenous oxycodone self-administration in the Hybrid Rat Diversity Panel", "authors": "Duffy, E.

Genetic background and sex also influenced additional phenotypes recorded during oxycodone self-administration including lever discrimination and timeout responding. The genetic contribution to these traits was slightly more moderate, with heritability estimates ranging between 0.25 to 0.42.

We investigated the function of sorghum grain pigmentation regulator Tannin1, the ortholog of Arabidopsis pleiotropic WD40 regulator TTG1, to test for conserved pleiotropic regulatory effects and to better understand the evolution of the MBW complex in Poaceae. We characterized genome-wide differential expression of leaf tissue using RNA sequencing in near-isogenic lines (NILs) that contrasted wildtype Tan1 and loss-of-function tan1-b alleles, under optimal temperature and chilling stress. Notably, Gene Ontology analyses revealed no pathways with differential expression between Tan1 and tan1-b NILs, suggesting that, in contrast to Arabidopsis TTG1, Tannin1 has no pleiotropic regulatory role in leaves. Further, NILs had no visible difference in anthocyanin pigmentation, and no genes with known or expected function in flavonoid synthesis were differentially expressed. Genome-wide, only 18 total genes were differentially expressed between NILs, with six of these genes located inside the NIL introgression region, an observation most parsimoniously explained by cis-regulatory effects unrelated to Tannin1 regulation.

Here, we used protein proximity labeling to search the GC{beta}-interacting proteins in ookinetes of the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii, and found the top hit Sir2A, a NAD+-dependent sirtuin family deacetylase. Sir2A interacts with GC{beta} throughout ookinete development. In mature ookinetes, Sir2A co-localizes with GC{beta} at OES in a mutually dependent manner. Parasites lacking Sir2A lose GC{beta} localization at OES, ookinete gliding, and mosquito infection, phenocopying GC{beta} deficiency. GC{beta} is acetylated at gametocytes but is deacetylated by Sir2A for OES localization at mature ookinetes. We further demonstrated that the level of NAD+, an essential co-substrate for sirtuin, increases during the ookinete development. The NAD+ at its maximal level until ookinete maturation promotes Sir2A-catalyzed GC{beta} deacetylation, ensuring GC{beta} localization at OES. This study highlights the spatiotemporal coordination of cytosolic NAD+ level and NAD+-dependent Sir2A in regulating GC{beta} deacetylation and dynamic localization for Plasmodium ookinete gliding", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616483", "title": "Dysregulation of lung epithelial cell homeostasis and immunity contributes to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease severity", "authors": "Sheahan, T.

While all three newly emerging human CoV from past 20 years (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) cause respiratory disease, each CoV has unique host interactions that drive differential pathogeneses. To better understand the virus and host interactions driving lethal MERS-CoV infection, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics analysis of sublethal and lethal MERS-CoV infection in mice. Significant differences were observed in body weight loss, virus titers and acute lung injury among lethal and sub-lethal virus doses. Virus induced apoptosis of type I and II alveolar epithelial cells suggest that loss or dysregulation of these key cell populations was a major driver of severe disease. Omics analysis suggested differential pathogenesis was multi-factorial with clear differences among innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as those that regulate lung epithelial homeostasis. Infection of mice lacking functional T and B-cells showed that adaptive immunity was important in controlling viral replication but also increased pathogenesis. In summary, we provide a high-resolution host response atlas for MERS-CoV infection and disease severity.

The HSAN-associated TECPR2 (R1336W) missense variant was deficient in Rab5-binding and, consequently, in membrane recruitment.

In this study, we present an integrated approach that combines tracking gas exchange between cyanobacteria and their environment with analysing the redox kinetics of the underlying photosynthetic electron transport chain. This combined system allows for real-time, simultaneous acquisition of respiration and photosynthesis data.

This level of accuracy was previously achievable only with specific cyanobacteria mutants.

By integrating a PNA linker into a small molecule probe of Riboglow platform, we enabled dual binding events: cobalamin (Cbl)-RNA structure-based recognition and sequence-specific PNA-RNA interaction. We show that incorporating a six-nucleotide PNA sequence complementary to the region of wild type RNA aptamer (env8) results in a 30-fold improvement in binding affinity compared to the probe with non-functional PEG linker.

We demonstrated that PNA probes effectively bind RNA both in vitro and in live cells, enhancing visualization of RNA in stress granules and U-bodies at low concentrations.

We aim to predict the circumstances in which pLMs can successfully perform zero-shot fitness estimation. Our work studies trends observed over hundreds of deep mutational scans across multiple different fitness objectives. We find that the likelihood, or abstractly, implicit preference of a certain protein sequence imbued during pretraining is predictive of fitness prediction capabilities. Both over-preferred and under-preferred wild type sequences harm performance. Using influence functions to causally understand how individual data points increase protein likelihoods, we find that there exists a power law tail due to sequence homology.

Transcription is the primary determinate of cell-state and most cellular perturbations (e.g. disease, drug treatment, or abiotic stressors) impact transcription by altering the activity of polymerases. Thus, the ability to detect and quantify detailed changes in polymerase activity would yield considerable insight into most cellular processes. Nascent run-on sequencing assays provide a direct readout of polymerase activity, but no tools exist that comprehensively model this activity at genes. Thus, we focus on RNA polymerase II (RNAP2), which is responsible for transcribing all protein-coding genes and many ncRNAs. Here we present the first model to fully capture the complete process of gene transcription by RNAP2. For an individual gene, this model parameterizes each distinct stage of RNAP2 transcription---Loading, Initiation, Elongation, and Termination, hence LIET---in a biologically interpretable way, and combines them in a Bayesian mixture model intended to be applied to nascent run-on sequencing data. Additionally, we provide a user-friendly, open-source software implementation of the model, which we use to demonstrate its performance. With our improved modeling of Loading and Initiation we demonstrate that these processes are characteristically different between sense (gene coding) and antisense (PROMPT) strands. Furthermore, our model is the first to robustly quantify the Termination phase of transcription. By applying the LIET model to 24 different human cell-types, our analysis indicates that the position of dissociation appears to be highly consistent across cell-types, indicative of a highly regulated process. Furthermore, by applying the LIET model to perturbation experiments, we demonstrate its ability to detect specific regulatory changes in pausing ratio (at 5'end), strand-bias, and dissociation location (at 3'end).

The lack of membranes also enables high-throughput screening of sensor designs and reaction optimizations.

The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments to execute; we therefore implement design-of-experiments to optimize the information gained from each design-build-test-learn cycle. We used these approaches to first optimize the performance of a low-cost cell-free expression formulation that was initially non-functional when embedded in paper, then further optimize it for tolerance to heat exposure.

The host innate response acts as the first line of defense, and CMV, like other viruses, has consequently evolved multiple mechanisms to manipulate host interferon (IFN) responses. DEAD-box Helicase 41 (DDX41) is an intracellular dsDNA sensor that, upon activation by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), triggers type I IFN production through the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling pathway. Here, we show the activation of this signaling pathway during lytic CMV infection, wherein BTK, DDX41, and STING are activated through tyrosine phosphorylation, and both DDX41 and BTK interact with STING. Further, CMV infection re-localizes DDX41 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it localizes to the perinuclear virus assembly compartment (vAC). Here, DDX41 phosphorylation is attenuated, suggesting cytoplasmic redistribution leads to a less active or inactive form. Additionally, DDX41 co-localizes in the vAC with the CMV tegument proteins, pp65 and pp71, each of which interact with DDX41 in immunoprecipitation assays. We further demonstrate the protective role of this signaling pathway, as treatment with the BTK inhibitor, orelabrutinib, attenuates DDX41 phosphorylation/activation and supports increased expression of viral proteins and virus replication. In sum, our work highlights the important role of BTK-DDX41-STING signaling in the innate immune response against CMV, which the virus subverts by attenuating its cytoplasmic activity, thereby diverting it from its typically protective function.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616540", "title": "Improved maximum growth rate prediction from microbial genomes by integrating phylogenetic information", "authors": "Xu, L.; Zakem, E.; Weissman, J.", "author_corresponding": "JL Weissman", "author_corresponding_institution": "Stony Brook University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.616540.source.xml", "abstract": "Microbial maximum growth rates vary widely across species and are key parameters for ecosystem modeling.

The relative toxicity of dissolved arsenic is related to its speciation, with As(V) being less toxic than As(III). Microorganisms have various mechanisms of arsenic resistance, including efflux and methylation. Microorganisms may also perform reduction/oxidation of As(V)/As(III) as part of their detoxification and/or metabolic pathways. We characterized the microbial communities along two aquifer transects associated with thermally mobilized arsenic near Northeastern Alberta oil sands deposits. 16S rRNA amplicons and metagenomic sequencing data of biomass from filtered groundwater indicated major changes in the dominant taxa between wells, especially those currently experiencing elevated arsenic concentrations. Annotation of arsenic-related genes indicated that efflux pumps (arsB, acr3), intracellular reduction (arsC) and methylation (arsM) genes were widespread amongst community members but comparatively few organisms encoded genes for arsenic respiratory reductases (arrA) and oxidases (arxA, aioA). While this indicates that microbes have the capacity to exacerbate arsenic toxicity by increasing the relative concentration of As(III), some populations of iron oxidizing and sulfate reducing bacteria (including novel Gallionella and Thermodesulfovibrionia populations) show potential for indirect bioremediation through formation of insoluble iron/sulfide minerals which adsorb or coprecipitate arsenic. An unusually high proportional abundance of a single Paceibacteria population that lacked arsenic resistance genes was identified in one high-arsenic well, and we discuss hypotheses for its ability to persist.

Here, we first experimentally assessed the stability of RNA in insects stored dry at room temperature over 72 weeks.

Next, we acquired Drosophila specimens from North American entomological collections to assess RNA survival in much older samples.

To investigate these questions, we combine three datasets: (1) feature norms for a database of ~1000 natural object images, (2) normative conceptual and perceptual memory data for those objects, and (3) neuroimaging data from an fMRI study collected using a subset (n=360) of those objects. We found that object-wise memorability elicits consistent brain activation across participants in key mnemonic regions (e.g., hippocampus and rhinal cortex), and that a substantial portion of the variance in this brain activity is mediated by the semantic factors describing these images. Regions with the strongest mediation effects are associated with sensory, motor, and visual processes, suggesting that the relationship between memorability and semantics may align with a sensory-functional account of the representation of concepts in the brain.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616469", "title": "Interpersonal Synchronization in Mother-Child Dyads: Neural and Motor Coupling as a Mechanism for Motor Learning and Development in Preschoolers", "authors": "Nagy, P.; Beres, L.; Toth, B.; Winkler, I.; Barthel, B.; Haden, G.

We recorded upper-body kinematics and dual-EEG from mothers and their preschool children during motor tasks and spontaneous face-to-face interactions. Our findings show that mother-child dyads synchronize their movements and neural activity, particularly in gamma band oscillations. This motor and neural synchrony evolves across task repetitions, with a strong correlation between motor and neural measures. Further, we observed that only motor synchronization was significantly related to the child's motor development stage, as assessed by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children.

CHR11 is also enriched at endogenous protein-coding genes (PCGs) producing nat-siRNAs and va-siRNAs under biotic or abiotic stresses, and this production is reduced in chr11 chr17 double mutants at genome-wide level.

Changes in the local mechanical environment of bone tissue occur during early metastasis, which might activate mechanobiological responses by resident bone cells (osteocytes) to activate resorption (osteoclasts) and thereby contribute to tumour invasion. The objective of this study is to investigate whether bone osteolysis is driven by early changes in the bone mechanical environment during metastasis by (a) implementing subject-specific FE models of metastatic femora to predict the mechanical environment within bone tissue during early metastasis (3-weeks after tumour inoculation) and then (b) applying mechanoregulation theory to predict bone tissue remodelling as a function of the evolving mechanical environment within bone tissue during breast cancer-bone metastasis. We implemented a global resorption rate derived from an experimental model, but the mechanoregulation algorithm predicted localised bone loss in the greater trochanter region, the same region where osteolysis was prevalent after three weeks of metastasis development in the animal model. Moreover, the mechanical environment evolved in a similar manner to that reported in separate subject-specific finite element models of these same animals by 6 weeks.

Offset analgesia (OA) describes the large decrease in perceived pain in response to a minor decrease in applied painful thermal stimulus. Here non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) of the cerebellum is used to probe OA. Methods : An OA protocol individualized to heat pain threshold (HPT) was applied via TSA-II (Medoc, Israel). Heat was ramped to HPT, with a transient temperature increase of HPT+1{degrees}C. NIBS interventions were applied prior to OA in 46 participants within a sham controlled repeated measures design. Cathodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and high-definition (4X1) transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) were applied in separate experimental sessions to examine whether diffuse (tDCS) or focal (HD-tDCS) stimulation differentially modulates OA. Results : OA induced hypoanalgesia was robust, with 90% of responses showing a substantial drop in perceived pain ({delta}VAS) following the 1{degrees}C fall in temperature, with an average VAS decrease of 38 in response to the 1{degrees}C fall in temperature. Cathodal cerebellar HD-tDCS enhances the analgesic impact of OA on four OA parameters (OA latency, VAS minimum, VAS mean and VAS 2nd max) relative to pre-stimulation. Conventional tDCS modulates two OA metrics relative to pre-stimulation (OA duration, VAS 2nd max) with an increase in OA duration following sham tDCS.

The similarity between the periodicity of SICF and indirect (I-)waves in the corticospinal volleys evoked by single-pulse TMS suggests that SICF originates from I-wave generating circuits. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of MEP generation by mapping the corticomotor representations of single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS targeting SICF1 and SICF2 peaks in 14 participants (7 female). MEPs were recorded from two hand muscles and the spatial properties of each corticomotor map were analyzed. For both hand muscles, we found a consistent posterior shift of the center-of-gravity (CoG) for SICF maps compared to single-pulse maps, with a larger shift for SICF1. CoG displacement in the SICF1 map correlated with individual SICF1 latencies. Further, ADM maps consistently peaked more medially than FDI maps and paired-pulse TMS resulted in larger corticomotor maps than single-pulse TMS. This is the first study to show that circuits responsible for SICF have a more posterior representation in the precentral crown than those generating MEPs via single-pulse TMS.

Since then, there have been several spillover events to cats, poultry, and humans. Multiple reports have discovered infectious virus in raw milk from infected dairy cows. Infectious virus can also last over a period on milking machine surfaces as a potential route of spread in cattle and contamination in raw milk. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared commercial pasteurized milk as safe for consumption given the lack of infectious virus, there have been numerous reports that up to 30 percent of commercial milk tested were positive for HPAI H5N1 influenza virus genome copies. This is not necessarily unique to the HPAI H5N1 virus, as retrospective studies have identified H1N1 and H3N2 seropositivity in cows linked to decreased milk production. However, it is unknown how repeat exposure to the remaining viral proteins and genomic material in pasteurized milk modulates immune responses once ingested. We developed a successful in-house pasteurization protocol that inactivated high viral loads of the pandemic H1N1 strain A/California/04/2009 (Cal09) or bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 (A/bovine/Ohio.B24OSU-439/2024) viruses in raw milk. Mice were administered this milk daily for five days and rechallenged with each respective virus. We found that repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus was not sufficient to prevent or accelerate mortality from lethal challenge of HPAI H5N1, though it did result in a ~0.5 log10 reduction viral titers in the brain and delayed clinical signs. In contrast, oral gavage of mice with pre existing immunity to H1N1 influenza virus with virus pasteurized in milk were protected from morbidity and mortality upon bovine H5N1 viral challenge.

As a result, in simulations of the leaf canopies of grain crops such as maize and sorghum, this trait is frequently approximated as alternating 180{degrees} angles between sequential leaves. We explore the feasibility of extracting direct measurements of the phyllotaxy of sequential leaves from 3D reconstructions of individual sorghum plants generated from 2D calibrated images and test the assumption of consistently alternating phyllotaxy across a diverse set of sorghum genotypes. Using a voxel-carving-based approach, we generate 3D reconstructions from multiple calibrated 2D images of 366 sorghum plants representing 236 sorghum genotypes from the sorghum association panel. The correlation between automated and manual measurements of phyllotaxy is only modestly lower than the correlation between manual measurements of phyllotaxy generated by two different individuals. Automated phyllotaxy measurements exhibited a repeatability of R2 = 0.41 across imaging timepoints separated by a period of two days.

While extensive research has explored this relationship, there remains a lack of studies specifically examining the statistical correlation between psychotic brain networks using high-order networks, considering the limitations of low-order networks. Moreover, these dysfunctions are believed to be linked to information imbalances in brain functions. However, our understanding of how these imbalances give rise to specific psychotic symptoms remains limited. Methods: This study aims to address this gap by investigating variations at the topological high-order level of the system with regard to specialization in both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Employing graph-theoretic brain network analysis, we systematically examine resting-state functional MRI data to delineate system-level distinctions in the connectivity patterns of brain networks. Results: The findings indicate that topological high-order functional connectomics highlight differences in the connectome between healthy controls and schizophrenia, demonstrating increased cingulo-opercular task control and salience interactions, while the interaction between subcortical and default mode networks, dorsal attention and sensory/somatomotor mouth decreases in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the segregation of brain systems in healthy controls compared to individuals with schizophrenia, which means the balance between segregation and integration of brain networks is disrupted in schizophrenia, suggesting that restoring this balance may aid in the treatment of the disorder. Additionally, the increased segregation and decreased integration of brain systems in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls may serve as a novel indicator for early schizophrenia diagnosis.

A systematic analysis of the transcriptional landscapes associated to PGC1 loss of expression revealed that PGC1 alters the expression of genes encoding for secreted proteins. Cell secretome studies corroborated that PGC1-dependent ERR regulation in prostate cancer cells suppresses the growth of tumor cells exposed to their conditioned media. The integration of in vitro and in vivo secretomics data and genetic perturbation assays revealed spermidine synthase as a transcriptional target of PGC1 and mediator of a paracrine metabolic growth suppressive effect. Moreover, the activity of the regulatory axis PGC1-ERR-SRM was reflected in patients and had prognostic value.

Using generalised linear mixed models, we find that current local (village-level) dog rabies incidence decreases with increasing recent local vaccination coverage. However, current local incidence is most dependent on recent incidence, both locally and in the wider district, consistent with high population connectivity. Removing the masking effects of prior non-local incidence shows that, for the same average prior vaccination coverage beyond the focal village, more spatial variation increases local incidence. These effects led to outbreaks following years when vaccination campaigns missed many villages, whereas when heterogeneity in coverage was reduced, incidence declined to low levels (<0.4 cases/1,000 dogs annually and no human deaths), such that short vaccination lapses thereafter did not lead to resurgence. We inferred ongoing rabies incursions into the district, suggesting regional connectivity as an important source of residual transmission.

Among the co-regulated genes with extreme outlier expression are also the hormone genes prolactin and growth hormone, both in mice and humans, for which we include also protein level data from human cohorts. Conclusions: We show that outlier patterns of gene expression are a biological reality occurring universally across tissues and species. Most of the outlier expressions are spontaneous and not inherited. We discuss the possibility that the outlier patterns reflect edge of chaos effects that are expected for systems of non-linear interactions and feedback loops, such as gene regulatory networks.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616423", "title": "Probing the limits of cis-acting gene regulation using a model of allelic imbalance quantitative trait loci", "authors": "Seoighe, C.; Connaire, S.; Chopra, M.", "author_corresponding": "Cathal Seoighe", "author_corresponding_institution": "National University of Ireland Galway", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "genomics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.10.03.616423.source.xml", "abstract": "Imbalance in gene expression between alleles is a hallmark of cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and several methods have been developed to exploit allelic imbalance to support the identification of eQTLs. Allelic imbalance is also of scientific and, potentially, clinical interest as it can erode the degree to which the effects of deleterious variants are buffered in a diploid organism and has been reported to be associated with the penetrance of pathological genomic variants. Here, we develop and apply a statistical model that is designed to evaluate whether the genotype of a locus is associated with the degree of allelic imbalance of a gene and refer to such loci as allelic imbalance quantitative trait loci (aiQTLs). An advantage of our approach is that it does not depend on linkage disequilibrium between the aiQTL and the associated gene and is, therefore, suited to the identification of eQTLs that act in cis over very large distances. We applied our model to data from the GTEx consortium and report, for the first time, the relationship between the distance of an eQTL from the TSS of the associated gene and the likelihood that the eQTL acts in cis. Previous studies have used a distance of 1Mb from the target gene as an indication that an eQTL acts in cis; however, our results suggest that the majority of eQTLs at distances more than 500kb from the TSS of the target gene are likely to act in trans (and thus to affect both gene copies). The model used here is also well suited to comparing the overall extent of allelic imbalance between samples. We show that in some tissues allelic imbalance is correlated with age; however, this correlation may be due to changes in the abundance of immune cell populations with age, as we found strong correlations between sample-level allelic imbalance and the inferred abundance of multiple immune cell types across whole blood samples.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616478", "title": "3D mechanical confinement directs muscle stem cell fate and function", "authors": "Park, G.; Grey, J.

We engineered an asymmetric 3D hydrogel bilayer platform with tunable physical constraints to mimic the regenerating MuSC niche.

MuSCs in unconfined two-dimensional (2D) environments exhibited larger nuclei and higher H4K16ac expression compared to those in more confined 3D conditions, leading to progressive activation, expansion, and myogenic commitment. This study highlights the importance of 3D mechanical cues in MuSC fate regulation, with 3D confinement acting as a mechanical brake on myogenic commitment, offering novel insights into the mechano-epigenetic mechanisms that govern MuSC behavior during muscle regeneration.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616533", "title": "Computational design and evaluation of optimal bait sets for scalable proximity proteomics", "authors": "Kasmaeifar, V.; Sedighi, S.; Gingras, A.-C.; Campbell, K.

These phenotypes are heterogeneous, dependent on the cell type arrested and the insult inciting arrest. Because a universal biomarker for CS has yet to be identified, combinations of senescence-associated biomarkers linked to various biological stress responses including lysosomal activity ({beta}-galactosidase staining), inflammation (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs), and apoptosis (senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways) are used to identify senescent cells. Using in vitro human bulk RNA-seq datasets, we find that senescent states enrich for various stress responses in a cell-type, temporal, and insult-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that various gene signatures used to identify senescent cells in the literature also enrich for stress responses, and are inadequate for universally and exclusively identifying senescent samples. Genes regulating stress responses - including transcription factors and genes controlling chromatin accessibility - are contextually differentially expressed, along with key enzymes involved in metabolism across arrest phenotypes. Additionally, significant numbers of SASP proteins can be predicted from senescent cell transcriptomes and also heterogeneously enrich for various stress responses in a context-dependent manner. We propose that 'senescence' cannot be meaningfully defined due to the lack of underlying preserved biology across senescent states, and CS is instead a mosaic of stress-induced phenotypes regulated by various factors, including metabolism, TFs, and chromatin accessibility.

We attribute this limitation to the optimization goals in classification, which tend to focus solely on the most representative features-an approach that is particularly inefficient for WSIs with gigapixel resolution. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on streaming convolution, an end-to-end method for WSI training.

Importantly, most proteins adopt multiple conformations with non-trivial ensemble distributions that change depending on their environment to perform functions like catalysis, signaling, and transport. Recently, machine learning techniques, especially deep generative models, have been employed to develop protein conformation generators. These models, known as unified protein ensemble samplers, are trained on the PDB dataset and can generate diverse protein conformation ensembles given a protein sequence. However, their reliance solely on structural data from the PDB, which primarily captures folded protein states, restricts the diversity of the generated ensembles and can result in physically unrealistic conformations. In this paper, we overcome these challenges by introducing EGDiff, an experiment-guided diffusion model for protein conformation generation. EGDiff integrates experimental measurements as a physical prior, enabling the generation of protein conformations with desired properties. Our experiments on a variety of fast-folding and intrinsically disordered proteins demonstrate that EGDiff significantly advances the capabilities of current unified protein ensemble samplers. With little computational cost, EGDiff can capture important proteins' configuration properties and the underlying Boltzmann distribution, paving the way for a next-generation molecular dynamics engine. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of EGDiff to capture conformational changes in the presence of mutations and as an efficient tool for determining a reasonable CV space for protein ensembles. With these results, EGDiff is well-poised to push the study of protein ensembles into a data-rich regime currently available to few problems in biology.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616471", "title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue identified multi-ciliary cells in breast cancer", "authors": "Gonzalez-Martinez, S.; Carretero-Barrio, I.; Perez-Mies, B.; Fernandez-Lanza, V.; Garcia-Cosio, M.; Caniego-casas, T.; Hardisson, D.; Estaban-Rodriguez, I.; Cortes, J.; Palacios, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jose Palacios", "author_corresponding_institution": "Ramon y Cajal University Hospital", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "cancer biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.10.04.616471.source.xml", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and fixed fresh (FF) samples for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).

Herein, we present a novel strategy for assembling long L-RNAs via the joining of two or more shorter fragments using cross-chiral ligase ribozymes together with new substrate activation chemistry. We show that 5'-monophosphorylated L-RNA, which is readily prepared by solid phase synthesis, can be activated by chemical attachment of a 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or diphosphate (ADP), yielding 5'-adenosyl (di- or tri-) phosphate L-RNA. The activation reaction is performed in mild aqueous conditions, proceeds efficiently with short or large L-RNA, and, yielding few biproducts, requires little or no further purification after activation. Importantly, both groups, when added to L-RNA, are compatible with ribozyme-mediated ligation, with the 5'-adenosyl triphosphate permitting rapid and efficient joining of multiple, long L-RNA strands. This is exemplified by the assembly of a 129-nt L-RNA molecule via a single cross-chiral ligation event. Overall, by relying on ribozymes that can be readily prepared by in vitro transcription and L-RNA substrates that can be activated through simple chemistry, these methods are expected to make long L-RNAs more accessible to a wider range of researchers and facilitate the expansion of L-ON-based technologies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616532", "title": "Design of bacterial DNT sensors based on computational models", "authors": "Bahiri Elitzur, S.; Shpigel, E.; Katzir, I.; Alon, U.; Belkin, S.; Tuller, T.", "author_corresponding": "Tamir Tuller", "author_corresponding_institution": "Tel Aviv University", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "synthetic biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.10.04.616532.source.xml", "abstract": "Detecting explosive compounds such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and its volatile byproduct 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) is paramount for public health and environmental safety.

However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and does not incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics.

We show, via model selection, that model discovery in SINDy with hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches.

Objectives: We tested whether two distinct neuroinflammatory markers are associated with cerebrovascular injury and amyloid-beta, and whether these markers are associated with plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau) concentration, medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortical and hippocampal atrophy, and memory deficits. We examined neuroinflammatory markers plasma YKL-40 and GFAP, due to previous conflicting evidence relating YKL-40 and GFAP to AD pathogenic markers. Design: Cross-sectional data from a community observational study (Biomarker Exploration in Aging, Cognition, and Neurodegeneration - BEACoN) were included. Setting: All participants were enrolled in a single site, at University of California, Irvine. Participants: 126 participants were included if they had at least one of the following measures available: neuropsychological data, MRI, amyloid-PET, or plasma. Exposures: Plasma YKL-40 and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels. Main outcomes and measures: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, 18F-florbetapir (FBP) PET mean SUVR, plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau-217) concentration, MTL cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, and memory function assessed by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Using path analysis, we tested whether higher plasma YKL-40 and GFAP are associated with WMH and amyloid-beta, and whether these converge to downstream markers of tauopathy, MTL neurodegeneration, and memory deficits. Results: In older adults without dementia (N=126, age=70.60+6.29, 62% women), we found that higher plasma YKL-40 concentration was associated with greater WMH volume, while higher plasma GFAP concentration was related to increased FBP SUVR. Further, higher plasma GFAP, WMH and FBP SUVR were independently associated with increased pTau-217. In turn, plasma pTau-217 was associated with reduced MTL cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. Subsequently, only reduced hippocampal volume was related to lower memory function. Conclusions and Relevance: Neuroinflammatory markers contribute to parallel pathways of cerebrovascular injury and amyloid-beta, which converge to tau-associated neurodegeneration and memory deficits in older adults.

The relationship between the extent of injury potentials and spinal cord injury (SCI) progression, as well as the potential pharmacological modulation of the immediate consequences of a trauma, have not yet been explored. To limit the peak of injury potentials and speed up recovery of reflex motor responses, we serially applied selective neurochemicals in the exact moment of an experimental physical trauma delivered through a calibrated device impacting the mid-thoracic cord of an entire CNS preparation of neonatal rats. Continuous lumbar root recordings monitored baseline DC-levels and reflex responses elicited by trains of electric pulses applied to sacrocaudal afferents. In uninjured preparations, each agent showed distinct effects on baseline polarization, modulation of synaptic responses, and appearance of bursting activity. Interestingly, neurochemicals acting on glutamatergic-, adenosinergic-, glycinergic- or GABAergic receptors, did not affect the monitored outcome when each parameter was normalized against pre-injury values. Conversely, the selective TRPV4 antagonist, RN1734, unlike the TRPA1 antagonist, AP18, reduced peak of injury potentials and speeded up full recovery of reflex responses within 1 min from trauma. Similarly, blockage of gap junctions quickly, yet partially, restored motor reflexes, while antagonism of GABAA receptors restored full reflexes, though slightly later.

Previous studies have primarily focused on morphological symmetry, such as neuron placement, leaving the symmetry in the functional architecture largely unexplored. The current study investigates this aspect within the Caenorhabditis elegans connectomes by introducing a graph-theoretic approach. By defining a 'mirror-symmetry index,' we quantitatively assess the symmetry in these connectomes, revealing a significant level of bilateral symmetry alongside notable asymmetry. Our approach also incorporates measures including connectivity similarity, motif-fingerprint differences, and path-compensation index to evaluate the network's functional redundancy and its capacity to compensate for unilateral disturbances. Here we show the C. elegans connectomes' robust bilateral symmetry, which not only facilitates similar functions across neuron pairs but also ensures resilience against disruptions. This redundancy is not confined to symmetrical connections; it also includes asymmetric ones, adding to the neural network's complexity. An in-depth analysis into different neuron types shows varied redundancy levels: high in interneurons, moderate in motor neurons, and low in sensory neurons. This pattern suggests a strategic neural design where diverse inputs from sensory neurons, coupled with the stable integration by interneurons, lead to coordinated actions through motor neurons.

Second, the transversal segregation of cell types conveniently allows synapses to form with appropriate targets. We demonstrate these principles in a model of the mouse spinal cord, where networks are constructed by probabilistic sampling of synaptic connections from cell-specific projection patterns, which are gleaned from literature. The cell-type distributions are derived from single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial transcriptomics. We find that essential aspects of locomotion are recapitulated and easily controlled, and several experimental observations can now be explained mechanistically.

Although traditionally considered exclusively somnogenic, recent studies identified a group of preoptic glutamatergic neurons that promote wakefulness. Specifically, our previous investigations demonstrated that chemogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic neurons within the medial-lateral preoptic area (MLPO_VGLUT2) promotes wakefulness, fragments non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMs), and suppresses REM sleep (REMs). This evidence is further supported by recent work showing that preoptic glutamatergic neurons are activated during microarousals that fragment sleep in response to stress, and optogenetic stimulation of these neurons promotes microarousals and wakefulness. Thus, while the wake-promoting function of MLPO_VGLUT2 is clear, their role in sleep homeostasis has not been assessed. We tested the hypothesis that MLPO_VGLUT2 are wake-active, and their activation will increase wakefulness and disrupt sleep homeostasis via projections to arousal-promoting systems. Using fiber photometry, we found that MLPO_VGLUT2 were highly active during REMs, wakefulness and brief arousals, and remained minimally active during NREMs. Chemogenetic stimulation of MLPO_VGLUT2 inhibited REMs onset and suppressed the REMs homeostatic response after total sleep deprivation. Chemogenetic inhibition of MLPO_VGLUT2 increased REMs time (during the light phase only) but did not influence REMs and NREMs homeostasis. Anterograde projection mapping revealed that MLPO_VGLUT2 innervate central regions that promote wakefulness and inhibit REMs. We conclude that MLPO_VGLUT2 powerfully suppress REMs and that exogenous (and possibly pathologic) activation of these neurons disrupts REMs recovery, presumably by directly or indirectly activating REMs-inhibitory mechanisms.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616501", "title": "Finding Agreement: fMRI-hyperscanning reveals that dyads explore in mental state space to align opinions.", "authors": "Speer, S.

Our analysis uncovered three key insights: First, individuals instructed to compromise rather than persuade tended to agree more at the end of the session. Second, hyperscanning and linguistic analyses revealed that encouraging compromise resulted in increased exploration during conversations; dyads given compromise instructions traversed more diverse mental states and topics. Third, heightened exploration was linked to greater eventual agreement. Notably, the effect of the compromise instruction on agreement was entirely mediated by the degree of exploration. Together, these results suggest that trying to find agreement may be spurred by exploration, something that happens when people are motivated to compromise but not persuade.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616580", "title": "APOE Protects Against Severe Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Restraining Production of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps", "authors": "Liu, D.; Jahn, A.

However, similar to humans, neutrophils account for approximately 45% of CD45+ cells in the lungs of Apoe-/- mice on a high-cholesterol (HC) diet following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We hypothesized that the susceptibility of Apoe-/- HC mice might arise from an unrestrained feed-forward loop in which production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) stimulates production of type I interferons by pDCs which in turn leads to the recruitment and activation of more neutrophils, and demonstrated that depleting neutrophils, depleting plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), or blocking type I interferon signaling, improved the outcome of infection. In concordance with these results, we found that Mtb-infected in Apoe-/- HC mice produce high levels of LTB4 and 12-HETE, two eicosanoids known to act as neutrophil chemoattractants and showed that blocking leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor signaling also improved the outcome of tuberculosis. While production of NETs has been associated with severe tuberculosis in other mouse models and in humans, a causative role for NETs in the pathology has not been directly established. We demonstrate that blocking the activation of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), an enzyme critical to NET formation, leads to fewer NETs in the lungs and, strikingly, completely reverses the hypersusceptibility of Apoe-/- HC mice to tuberculosis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616494", "title": "Lung CD4+ resident memory T cells use airway secretory cells to stimulate and regulate neutrophilic allergic airways disease.", "authors": "Ravi, V.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) target the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface, can neutralize a broad range of the highly diverse circulating HCV strains and are essential tools to inform vaccine design. However, bNAbs targeting a single E1E2 epitope might be limited in neutralization breadth, which can be enhanced by using combinations of bNAbs that target different envelope epitopes. We have generated 60 IgG-like bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that can simultaneously target two distinct epitopes on E1E2. We combine non-overlapping E1E2 specificities into three types of bsAbs, each containing a different hinge length. The bsAbs show retained or increased potency and breadth against a diverse panel of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) and HCV produced in cell culture (HCVcc) compared to monospecific and cocktail controls. Additionally, we demonstrate that changes in the hinge length of bsAbs can alter the binding stoichiometry to E1E2. These results provide insights into the binding modes and the role of avidity in bivalent targeting of diverse E1E2 epitopes, and suggest structural differences between HCVpp and HCVcc.

Warming treatments elevated atmospheric temperatures by 1.2 and 3.3 oC (passive and active warming), respectively, but did not affect soil temperatures. Nevertheless, soils in the active warming treatment exhibited significantly lower water content than ambient conditions. Overall, soil bacterial diversity and richness (June, July, and August data combined) under the warming (passive and active) treatments and ambient controls did not demonstrate significant differences after two years of experimental warming. However, significantly higher bacterial evenness and diversity under warming treatments were observed in the early growing season (June). Our study also reveals pronounced seasonal shifts in the evenness and diversity of bacteria in wild blueberry soil, suggesting that the variation in bacterial community structure may be more influenced by seasonal changes in temperature and plant activity during the growing season than by warming treatments.

NHEJ involves minimal end-processing and drives direct ligation of the broken ends, while HR first requires a DSB resection step that degrades 5' strands to generate 3' ssDNA tails necessary for homology search. When HR fails, an alternative end-joining pathway involving polymerase theta can serve as a backup repair mechanism by annealing and ligating microhomologies present in ssDNA tails on either side of a resected DSB. Resection is the early step that commits a DSB to repair by HR, and is therefore considered a prerequisite for TMEJ as well. It has been proposed that the exonuclease EXO1 and the helicase/nuclease complex of BLM-DNA2 have redundant roles in resection, and therefore may both contribute to TMEJ. Here, we use a sensitive deep-sequencing approach to identify DSB repair outcomes at an endogenous locus in response to genetic and chemical perturbation of the resection machinery. While we observe that both EXO1 and BLM-DNA2 contribute to resection, our findings highlight a predominant role for BLM-DNA2 in facilitating TMEJ. However, careful cell cycle analysis revealed that BLM-DNA primarily contributes to TMEJ by ensuring normal progression to the G2/M transition, required for TMEJ to become activated. We propose that rather than direct, mechanistic roles in resection, the critical functions of BLM and DNA2 in genome replication largely account for their genetic contribution to efficient TMEJ.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.615095", "title": "Synergy between cis-regulatory elements can render cohesin dispensable for distal enhancer function", "authors": "Hansen, K.

We show that SSNA-1 genetically interacts with the centriole stability factor SAS-1 and is required post assembly for centriole structural integrity. In SSNA-1s absence, centrioles assemble but fracture leading to extra spindle poles. However, if the efficiency of cartwheel assembly is reduced, the absence of SSNA-1 results in daughter centriole loss and monopolar spindle formation, indicating that the cartwheel and SSNA-1 cooperate to stabilize the centriole during assembly.

Following infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages with metacyclic L. amazonensis promastigotes, we observed that VAPA gradually associates with communal parasitophorous vacuoles. Knockdown of VAPA prevented the replication of L. amazonensis, which was accompanied by an impaired parasitophorous vacuole expansion.

Furthermore, by influencing histone eviction and the assembly of protamines, it ensures proper chromatin condensation and genome packaging in mature spermatozoa. The disruption of Atad2 results in aberrant mature spermatozoa genome organization, impacting male fertility.

Recent findings of ectopic expression of LEC markers including Prospero Homeobox 1 (PROX1), a master regulator of lymphatic differentiation, and the vascular permeability marker Plasmalemma Vesicle Associated Protein (PLVAP), in certain glioblastoma and brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), has prompted investigation into their roles in cerebrovascular malformations, tumor environments, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) abnormalities. To explore the relationship between ectopic LEC properties and BBB disruption, we utilized endothelial cell-specific Prox1 overexpression mutants. When induced during embryonic stages of BBB formation, endothelial Prox1 expression induces hybrid blood-lymphatic phenotypes in the developing CNS vasculature. This effect is not observed when Prox1 is overexpressed during postnatal BBB maturation. Ectopic Prox1 expression leads to significant vascular malformations and enhanced vascular leakage, resulting in BBB disruption when induced during both embryonic and postnatal stages. Mechanistically, PROX1 downregulates critical BBB-associated genes, including {beta}-catenin and Claudin-5, which are essential for BBB development and maintenance. These findings suggest that PROX1 compromises BBB integrity by negatively regulating BBB-associated gene expression and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.615777", "title": "Germplasm stability in zebrafish requires maternal Tdrd6a and Tdrd6c", "authors": "Consorte, A.; El Sherif, Y.; Kielisch, F.; Wittkopp, N.; Ketting, R.

To test these techniques, we analyze the transcriptomes of two male reproductive organs, testes and accessory glands, across 11 species of the Drosophila melanogaster species group. We first discretize gene expression states by estimating the probability that each gene is expressed in each organ and species. We then define a phylogenetic model of correlated transcriptome evolution in two or more organs and fit it to the expression state data.

Sakura is predominantly expressed in the ovaries, particularly in the germline cells, including GSCs. sakura null mutant female flies display rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous phenotypes, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. The germline-specific depletion of sakura impairs Dpp/BMP signaling, leading to aberrant bag-of-marbles (bam) expression, resulting in faulty differentiation and loss of GSCs. Additionally, sakura is necessary for normal piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) levels and for proper localization of Oo18 RNA-binding protein (Orb) in developing oocytes. We identified Ovarian Tumor (Otu) as protein binding partner of Sakura, and we found that loss of otu phenocopies loss of sakura in ovaries.

The collection was evaluated for powdery mildew resistance under field conditions for two consecutive years and at the seedling stage with 10 different wheat powdery mildew isolates. Results: To identify the genetic basis of mildew resistance in wheat, we developed a k-mer-based GWAS approach using multiple fully-assembled genomes including Triticum aestivum as well as four progenitor genomes. Compared to approaches based on single reference genomes, we unambiguously mapped an additional 25% resistance-associated k-mers. Our approach outperformed SNP-based GWAS in terms of number of loci identified and precision of mapping. In total, we detected 34 (Pm) powdery mildew resistance loci, including seven previously-described and more importantly 27 novel loci active at the seedling stage.

There are over 350 recognized dog breeds that provide the foundation for investigating the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity. Typically, breed standard phenotypes such as stature, fur length, and craniofacial structure are analyzed in genetic association studies. However, such analyses are limited to the assayed phenotypes, leaving difficult to measure phenotypic subtleties potentially overlooked. In this study, the genotype-first approach was adapted to the dog genome to investigate coding variation from over 2000 dogs, leading to discoveries of new mutations related to craniofacial morphology and stature. Breed-enriched variants were prioritized according to gene constraint, which was calculated using a mutation model derived from trinucleotide substitution probabilities in the dog. Among the discovered variants was a splice-acceptor mutation in PDGFRA associated with bifid nose, a characteristic trait of Catalburun dogs, implicating the gene's role in midline closure, and a frameshift mutation in LCORL associated with large canine body size, thus highlighting the importance of allelic heterogeneity in selection for breed traits. Most priority variants were not associated with genomic signatures for breed differentiation, as these regions were enriched for constrained genes intolerant to nonsynonymous variation, suggesting a model of breed phenotype diversification based on regulatory changes to essential genes. Identification of trait-associated variants in dogs informs new biological roles for genes.

Classical literature from Weihs and Lighthill suggests that fish schools should favor planar diamond formations to increase hydrodynamic efficiency, inspiring a large body of work ranging from fluid simulations to hydrofoil experiments. However, whether fish schools actually adopt and maintain this idealized formation remains debated and unresolved. When fish schools are free to self-organize in three dimensions, what formations do they prefer? By tracking polarized schools of giant danios (Devario aequipinnatus) swimming continuously for ten hours, we demonstrate that fish rarely stay in a horizontal plane, and even more rarely, in the classical diamond formation. Of all fish pairs within four body-lengths from each other, only 25.2% are in the same plane. Of these, 54.6% are inline, 30.0% are staggered, and 15.4% are side-by-side. The diamond formation was observed in less than 0.1% of all frames. Notably, a \"ladder formation\" emerged as the most probable formation for schooling giant danios, appearing in 79% of all fish pairs and fish schools elongate at higher swimming speeds. These findings highlight the dynamic and three-dimensional nature of fish schools and suggest that hydrodynamic benefits may be obtained without requiring fixed positions.

Currently, an experimental structure of nitazene bound to the molecular target, the mu-opioid receptor (muOR), is lacking, hindering the understanding of their structure-activity relationships. Here we employed a suite of computational approaches, encompassing consensus docking, metadynamics, and conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) refinement, to determine the putative muOR binding poses of eight nitazenes, including the nitro-containing meto-, eto-, proto-, buto-, and isotonitazene and the nitro-less metodes-, etodes-, and protodesnitazene. Docking generated three possible binding modes, whereby the nitro-substituted or unsubstituted benzimidazole group extends into subpocket 1 (SP1) between transmembrane helix (TM) 2 and 3, subpocket 2 (SP2) between TM2, TM7, and TM1 or subpocket 3 (SP3) between between TM5 and TM6. Metadynamics and cMD simulations suggested that the SP2-binding mode is most stable for etonitazene and analogs as well as etodesnitazene. Based on the comparison to the experimental structures of BU72-, fentanyl- and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (MP)-bound muOR, we proposed a general model for receptor-opioid recognition, which involves interactions with SP1, SP2 and SP3. The hydrophobic SP1 prefers an aromatic moiety, such as the phenyl ring of BU72 and fentanyl. In contrast, the hydrophilic SP2 and SP3 favor a polar group which can form water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions with the conserved Tyr75 and His297.

Investigating STAT1's function in isogenic colorectal tumor cells with wild-type or mutant KRAS, we found that STAT1 specifically promotes the survival and proliferation of cells with mutant KRAS. Through gene expression profiling, we discovered a previously unknown role of STAT1 in upregulating sterol and lipid biosynthetic genes specifically in mutant KRAS cells. This effect is driven by STAT1 phosphorylation at serine 727 and its cooperation with STAT3 and STAT5 for the transcriptional upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) 1 and 2, which boost de novo sterol and lipid biosynthesis. In mutant KRAS cells, STAT1 amplifies the mevalonate pathway, maintaining its serine 727 phosphorylation through RHO GTPase signaling and establishing a positive feedback loop through the transcription factors YAP1 and TEAD4, further driving lipid biosynthesis and tumor growth. Through xenograft tumor assays in mice, we discovered that the STAT1-YAP1 axis plays a role in mutant KRAS tumor cells' resistance to mevalonate pathway inhibitors, which can be overcome by pharmacologically targeting the YAP1-TEAD interaction. Additionally, the STAT1-YAP1 arm is essential for the intrinsic resistance to EGFR-targeting therapy in the mutant KRAS colon cancer cells.

Little emphasis has been placed on holistic field-based studies, where wind and rain play crucial roles. This study fills that gap by attempting to unravel the processes by which rainfall affects airborne spore concentrations over a wheat canopy during active rust epidemics. Over more than two months, bi-hourly spore counts from Burkard traps were integrated with detailed meteorological data, revealing both seasonal and diurnal trends. Diurnal peaks in airborne spore concentrations, typically driven by cyclic changes in wind and humidity, were dramatically altered by rain. Rain events either amplified spore concentrations by up to 25-fold through 'rain-puff' and/or depletes them via 'wash-out' and 'wash-off'. Rains events from the dataset were classified into categories with distinct impacts: 'precursor' rains often trigger spore release, while 'follower' (and prolonged rains) reduce airborne spore concentrations. Moreover, differences in the dispersal dynamics of Pst and Pt were observed, and some were linked to how humidity and wind influence spore clustering.

Extensive experimental evidence indicates that the gustatory cortex (GC) is engaged in taste perception, palatability and preference. However, our knowledge of the neural and neurochemical signals regulating taste preference is rather limited. Neuromodulators can affect preferences, though their effects on neural circuits for taste are incompletely understood. Neurosteroids are of particular interest in view of reports that systemic administration of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a potent modulator of tonic GABAergic inhibition, induces hyperphagia and increases intake of energy rich food in human and animal subjects. Tonic inhibition is a powerful modulator of circuit excitability and is primarily mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors containing the delta subunit ({delta}-GABAARs). These receptors are widely distributed in the brain, but information regarding the expression of {delta}-GABAARs within gustatory circuits is lacking, and their role in taste preference has not been investigated. Here, we focused on GC to investigate whether activation of {delta}-GABAARs affects sweet taste preference in adult mice. Our data reveal that {delta}-GABAARs are expressed in multiple cell types within GC. These receptors mediate an allopregnanolone-sensitive tonic current and decrease sweet taste preference by altering the behavioral sensitivity to sucrose concentration in a cell type-specific manner. Our findings demonstrate that taste sensitivity and preference in the adult mammalian brain are modulated by tonic inhibition mediated by neurosteroid-activated {delta}-GABAARs in GC.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616448", "title": "Impact of JN.1 booster vaccination on neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3.1.1 and XEC", "authors": "Arora, P.; Happle, C.; Kempf, A.; Nehlmeier, I.; Stankov, M.

Metagenomic-based analyses have revealed that soil pH selects for distinct populations and community structures for both phage and hosts at local and global scales. However, whether contrasting soil pH represents a selective barrier for phages capable of infecting an individual host is unknown. To examine the influence of pH on individual host-virus interactions, two closely related Bacillus strains were isolated and characterized from pH 7.5 soil associated with a long-term contiguous pH gradient (pH 4.5 to 7.5). Phages infecting each strain were subsequently enriched from soils across the pH gradient (pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5), enumerated using a plaque assay, and characterized via metagenomic analysis. Phages infecting each strain were cultivated from all soils but their community composition and abundance varied with pH. Phage populations infecting each of the two strains were distinct despite the close relatedness of the two hosts, indicating relatively narrow host ranges for each virus.

Fencing off experimental areas (exclosures) has been a common experimental approach to assess how removing large-body size hosts may affect disease risk, especially with tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) such as those causing Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. However, exclosure experiments have found conflicting results based on the scale of the experiment, with smaller exclosures tending to increase tick densities inside the exclosure (suggesting large incompetent mammal hosts produce a dilution effect) and larger exclosures tending to decrease tick densities inside (suggesting an amplification effect). Previously, we have lacked a unifying theoretical framework able to reconcile the results of exclosure experiments on multiple spatial scales. Here we present a spatially explicit model of TBP risk incorporating tick dispersal by small competent mammal hosts (rodents) which can enter the exclosure and by large incompetent mammal hosts (deer) which are excluded from the exclosure. Our model reproduces the scale-dependence observed in past exclosure experiments and neatly illustrates the mechanisms that cause it. Specifically, the modeled exclosure produces high densities of infected questing ticks near its boundary due to a dilution effect with deer, but the density drops off steeply moving into the exclosure's center due to the limits of rodent-based tick dispersal. Though this contrasts with empirical results which have found lower tick densities at the exclosure's edge than its center, we demonstrate that this contrasting pattern can also be produced if we additionally allow ticks in their free-living questing stage to disperse. We derive analytic expressions for our model's resulting infected tick density gradients inside the exclosure, and encourage empiricists to test for such tick density gradients in future exclosure experiments rather than averaging measurements over the entire exclosure.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616481", "title": "Interspecies hybridization as a route of accessory chromosome origin in fungal species infecting wild grasses", "authors": "Fagundes, W.

In spite of the profound impact on genome organization, the origin of accessory chromosomes in Z. tritici is still poorly understood. Combining genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, we discovered a new chromosome in Z. tritici isolates infecting wild grasses from the genus Aegilops, and we use this discovery to study the origin of accessory chromosomes. The newly identified chromosome presents similar characteristics to known accessory chromosomes in Zymoseptoria species, including presence-absence variation, low gene expression in vitro and in planta, and enrichment with heterochromatin-associated histone methylation marks (H3K27me3). Interestingly, we found an orthologous chromosome in Zymoseptoria ardabiliae, a closely related fungal species also infecting wild grasses. This ortholog chromosome also presents accessory chromosomes characteristics, but lacks the enrichment of heterochromatin-associated methylation marks. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the orthologous chromosome in Z. ardabiliae harbors active transposable elements (TEs) congruent with lower signatures of host-genome defense mechanisms against TE expansion and spread (quantified as repeat-induced-point (RIP) mutation signatures). Our findings suggest that the chromosome has been exchanged between Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae by introgressive hybridization events underlining the relevance of hybridization in the evolution of new accessory chromosomes.

Malvidin was more potent than Echioidinin across all parasite stages and species. For L. amazonenses, Malvidin's inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were 197.71{+/-}17.20 M and 258.07{+/-}17 M (stationary and axenic amastigotes, respectively); whereas Echioidinin revealed IC50 values of 272.99{+/-}29.90 M and 335.96{+/-}19.35 M (stationary and axenic amastigotes, respectively). AmpB showed IC50 values of 0.06{+/-}0.01 M and 0.10{+/-}0.03 M, respectively.

We extracted N1 amplitude and latency from the Cz electrode using an advanced, computationally-intensive approach that relies on large amounts of data (e.g., 64 channels, many trials), Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Internal consistency was quantified by split-half reliability using the Spearman correlation coefficient. N1s varied across individuals (amplitude:12-82V, latency: 142-282ms), yet within individuals, the N1 showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>0.9) across a one-week and one-year time span. N1 amplitude reached excellent internal reliability for each session and group (r>0.9), that generally plateaued within 6 trials, while more trials were needed to reliably measure N1 latency. Similar results were obtained when quantifying N1s using a minimal approach performed with only three electrodes and simple preprocessing. Overall, the N1 is stable within and across sessions, and is largely independent of approach suggesting it could be a clinically-feasible biomarker of balance function. Characterizing reliability in populations with neurologic dysfunction and in different environmental contexts will be necessary to enhance our understanding of the N1, optimize experimental design, and determine its predictive validity of clinical outcomes (e.g., falls risk).", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616574", "title": "SPLASH-structure: a statistical approach to identify RNA secondary structures from raw sequencing data, bypassing multiple sequence alignment", "authors": "Wang, J.

Traditional experimental methods for RNA structure determination such as X-ray crystallography or chemical mapping are incisive; however, these approaches suffer from low-throughput and low-dimensionality, respectively. Computational approaches, leveraging evolutionary signals from correlated positions' mutations, provide an alternative means to infer RNA structures. However, these methods require assembly, and face challenges due to statistical biases inherent in multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Furthermore, these methods cannot make use of the full spectrum of natural variations seen for a given RNA element. Here, we introduce SPLASH-structure, a direct assembly-free, MSA-free, and metadata-free statistical method for identifying conserved RNA structures by analyzing raw sequencing data, quantifying compensatory mutations or stem variation exclusion in the putative RNA structures. We show SPLASH-structure rediscovers known HIV structural elements and identifies conserved rRNA structures in metatranscriptomics samples. Moreover, SPLASH-structure finds Culex narnavirus 1, Gordis virus, and Culex mosquito virus 4, as well as previously unannotated viral genomes in mosquito metatranscriptomics samples de novo, highlighting the method's potential for viral discovery.

Although restenosis rates are significantly reduced by the development of drug-eluting, the stent may not be implanted at all atherosclerotic sites, and long-term dual anti-platelet therapy is needed after stent implantation. Thus, it is essential to elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying neointimal formation for developing novel therapies. Latexin (LXN), a previously identified pro-inflammatory protein, is highly expressed in vasculature and its expression is regulated by shear stress. Whether it plays a role in vascular remodeling, however, remains unknown. Objective: To determine whether LXN is involved in neointimal formation, and if so, to define the molecular mechanisms involved. Methods and Results: We found that the expression of LXN was significantly increased in neointimal hyperplasia, as determined by western blot. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that increased LXN expression was predominantly localized in smooth muscle cells and macrophages. To determine the cell specific roles of LXN in neointimal formation after injury, we generated global, smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific, endothelial specific-, and myeloid-specific LXN knockout (KO) mice. We found that global, SMC-, and myeloid-specific LXN deficiency markedly prevented neointimal hyperplasia in mice after carotid artery ligation, whereas LXN deficiency in endothelial cells had no effects. Mechanistically, we found that LXN deficiency in SMCs significantly attenuated SMC proliferation and migration, mainly through inhibiting the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. Intriguely, LXN deficiency in macrophages inhibited monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)-induced macrophage migration through inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. Conclusions: In summary, we for the first time demonstrated that LXN is essentially involved in SMC proliferation and microphage migration. Specific inhibition of LXN signaling may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as restenosis and atherosclerosis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616630", "title": "A single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping panel for efficient genetic stock identification of the Teno river Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population complex", "authors": "Johansson, H.; Erkinaro, J.; Falkegard, M.; Foldvik, A.; Orell, P.; Primmer, C.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose physiological role is related to the modulation of microtubule dynamics and the correct axonal transport in neurons. In tauopathies, the mechanism of conversion of the tau molecule from a physiological to a pathological form is still unclear. Nevertheless, two hexapeptide sequences, named PHF6 and PHF6*, located in the R3 and R2 repetition domains of tau, respectively, seem to be crucial in triggering the aggregation. In the native state, the hydrophobic residues of PHF6 and PHF6* are protected by a {beta}-hairpin-like structure. Contrary to that, the misfolded protein exposes hydrophobic residues, which can form hydrophobic interactions and drive the self-assembly process. Chemical model systems, other than being more straightforward and easily accessible than full-length proteins, can provide valuable insight, which is difficult to tease out by studying the natural systems directly, and can especially be employed to examine the structures and modes of folding of amyloid proteins. Here, we exploit the use of chemical systems to modulate and study the mechanism of tau misfolding and aggregation. By employing a new non-natural {beta}2,2-amino acid, we have induced the two hot spot sequences of tau (PHF6 and PHF6*) either to have a totally extended conformation or a {beta}-hairpin, according to the (S) or (R) stereochemistry of the scaffold, respectively. The aim of this work was to provide, through the interchange between {beta}-hairpin-like and extended conformations, a possible explanation for the mechanism of tau misfolding. We demonstrated that an extended conformation, exposing the hydrophobic residues of both sequences and driving away PHF6* from PHF6, can trigger the aggregation of tau and behaves as a seed-competent monomer model system. Conversely, a {beta}-hairpin imitates the favorable folding of tau, allowing the protein to maintain its soluble monomeric form. Furthermore, a {beta}-hairpin mimic, based on the chaperone protein Hsp90, demonstrated the further application of this type of peptidomimetic foldamers as both aggregation inhibitors and chaperone mimics for the corrective folding of tau in a neuronal environment.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616649", "title": "An active matter model captures the spatial dynamics of actomyosin oscillations during morphogenesis", "authors": "Mackay, E.

Findings: The bimodal size distribution of starch from most wheat and barley cultivars could be best described with a mixed distribution curve. A log-normal distribution was fitted to the small B-type granules, and a normal distribution was fitted to the large A-type granules, allowing estimation of their relative abundance and size parameters, despite their overlapping size distributions.

Prolonged periods of low oxygen and high organic matter input have been put forward to cause an imbalanced microbial methane cycle, as methane oxidation cannot keep up with methane production. However, it is still unclear what factors affect each process and which microorganisms are responsible. Here we show that methanogenic processes dominate microbial methane cycling in the anoxic sediments of marine Lake Grevelingen (NL) after summer stratification with bottom water anoxia. We observed a shallow and narrow sulfate-methane transition zone between 5 and 15 cm depth, with high methane concentrations (> 5 mM) below this zone. Methanogenesis was dominant over methanotrophy in all investigated layers as active methanogenesis potential was detected down to 60 cm below sea floor, but methane oxidation was only observed in a narrow section of the sulfate-methane transition zone. Based on amplicon sequencing and sediment incubations, we uncovered a metabolically and phylogenetically diverse methanogenic community with distinct niche separation in different sediment layers. ANME archaea and their putative syntrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria were restricted to a narrow zone and were co-occurring with the detected methane oxidation activity.

While alterations in ECM composition and stiffness are known to impact cell behavior, the specific roles of each of these cues for melanocyte functions remain unclear. To explore the impact of these extrinsic cues, we here exposed murine melanocytes to different ECM proteins as well as varying substrate stiffnesses. This study identified MITF, a key regulator of melanocyte differentiation and function, as an ECM- and mechanosensitive transcription factor. We further revealed that distinct ECM proteins and substrate stiffness engage a MEK/ERK/MITF signaling axis to control melanocyte functions. Exposure of melanocytes to collagen I restricted ERK activation, promoting high nuclear MITF levels associated with melanocyte proliferation and differentiation. Conversely, fibronectin elicited elevated ERK activation, leading to low nuclear MITF, correlating with a dedifferentiated and motile phenotype. Importantly, inhibiting ERK activity in melanocytes cultured on fibronectin led to increased MITF nuclear localization, MITF target gene expression and enhanced melanogenesis. Additionally, we uncovered that melanocyte mechanoresponses differ depending on the specific ECM environment.

To illuminate the chromatin regulatory landscape in B-ALL, we analyzed 3D genome organization, open chromatin, and gene expression in 53 primary patient samples. At the level of 3D genome organization, we identified chromatin interactions that vary across transcriptional subtypes. These sites of variable 3D chromatin interactions correlate with local gene expression changes and are enriched for core drivers of B-ALL observed in genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens. Sites of variable 3D genome interactions are frequently shared across multiple transcriptional subtypes and are enriched for open chromatin sites found in normal B-cell development but repressed in mature B-cells. Within an individual patient sample, the chromatin landscape can resemble progenitor chromatin states at some loci and mature B-cell chromatin at others, suggesting that the chromatin in B-ALL patient tumor cells is in a partially arrested immature state. By analyzing transcriptomic data from large cohorts of B-ALL patients, we identify gene expression programs that are shared across transcriptional subtypes, associated with B-cell developmental stages, and predictive of patient survival.

This study investigates the intricate connections among amino acids, metabolic processes, growth, sleep patterns, amino acid-deficient diets, and caffeine consumption. Emphasizing the crucial links between diet, oxidative stress, and cognitive health, the research underscores the essential role of quality sleep in maintaining cognitive function. The bidirectional relationship between disrupted sleep and cognitive health, as well as the impact of caffeine on cognitive function, is explored. The study involved adult male Wistar rats divided into 10 groups A - J based on cage conditions and diet. Group A-E were kept in a normal cage with diets containing varying levels of tryptophan and other essential amino acids, while Group F-J underwent sleep deprivation using a disk-over-water method and received diets with varying tryptophan and other essential amino acid levels, in addition to caffeine. The experiment spanned 2 weeks, blood samples were collected on days 1,4,7, and 13 for relevant biochemical serum analyses, and the rats were sacrificed on the fourteenth day for blood sample collection, biochemical assays, and brain histology. The 2-week experiment revealed a linear decrease in melatonin and serotonin levels across all caffeine-administered groups, possibly due to stress and anxiety as compared with the reduction in these parameters observed in control rats, suggesting melatonin and serotonin as potential sleep deprivation biomarkers. Testosterone and insulin-like growth hormone assays showed a significant decrease in sleep-deprived rats with caffeine, impacting secondary sex characteristics and growth. Elevated TNF- and interleukin-1b levels in the caffeine-administered, sleep-deprived group suggest potential health risks associated with sleep deprivation and caffeine. Serum assays for antioxidant enzymes indicated heightened oxidative stress in sleep-deprived rats with caffeine. Histopathological studies revealed cellular abnormalities in the sleep-deprived group, indicating increased cellular metabolism and potential pathological conditions. This study elucidates the complex relationships among sleep, dietary factors, and hormonal and inflammatory responses. It underscores the potential neurotoxic effects associated with caffeine consumption when coupled with sleep deprivation. These results underscore the urgent need for further investigation into dietary strategies that could alleviate these adverse effects and promote better health.

We focused on a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit-like (Chrnal-E), based on its differential expression, and selected animals for a second round of RNAseq that included both light-based and mechanically-based sleep-deprivation.

First, we found that chemical cholinergic neuromodulators positively regulate pacemaker activity. Then, we showed by in situ hybridization that chrnal-E is expressed primarily within the ganglia, and that the area of expression expands after sleep deprivation. Next, we developed RNAi for use in Cassiopea and determined that Chrnal-E promotes wakefulness. Finally, we sampled circadian timepoints in the field and found in control conditions, chrnal-E has lowest expression late at night, but in sleep deprived animals, chrnal-E peaks at this time, supporting a link to wakefulness.

We found that taurine-conjugated bile acids (tauro-BAs), including taurine-conjugates of cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid (TCA, TDCA, TLCA, TCDCA, respectively) activate large populations of VSNs at sub-micromolar concentrations.

Tauro-BA-sensitive VSNs were also insensitive to well-studied sulfated steroids, suggesting tauro-BAs activate vomeronasal receptors that have not yet been de-orphaned. Among the tauro-BAs, TDCA displayed particularly strong potency, activating many VSNs at sub-micromolar concentrations. Tauro-BAs were not detectable in mouse fecal extracts by mass spectrometry, but were found in reptile fecal extracts and germ-free mouse fecal extracts. VSN responses to germ-free and conventional mouse fecal extracts, conjugated bile acids, and tauro-BAs revealed that non-overlapping populations of VSNs respond to germ-free and conventional mouse feces.

The ultimate goal of this process is to produce neural dynamics that enable the rich repertoire of behaviors we perform with our limbs. What begins as a series of \"babbles\" coalesces into skilled motor output as the brain rapidly learns to control the body. However, the nature of the teaching signal underlying this normative learning process remains elusive. Here, we test two well-established and biologically plausible theories-supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL)-that could explain how neural circuits develop the capacity for skilled movements. We trained recurrent neural networks to control a biomechanical model of a primate arm using either SL or RL and compared the resulting neural dynamics to populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex of monkeys performing the same movements. Intriguingly, only RL-trained networks produced neural activity that matched their biological counterparts in terms of both the geometry and dynamics of population activity. We show that the similarity between RL-trained networks and biological brains depends critically on matching biomechanical properties of the limb. We then demonstrated that monkeys and RL-trained networks, but not SL-trained networks, show a strikingly similar capacity for robust short-term behavioral adaptation to a movement perturbation, indicating a fundamental and general commonality in the neural control policy. Together, our results support the hypothesis that neural dynamics for behavioral control emerge through a process akin to reinforcement learning.

However, optimal subcortical targets for therapeutic stimulation are not well established. Here, we leveraged 7 Tesla resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 168 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project to map the subcortical connectivity of six canonical cortical networks that modulate higher-order cognition and function: the default mode, executive control, salience, dorsal attention, visual, and somatomotor networks. Based on spatiotemporally overlapped networks generated by the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition method, our goal was to identify subcortical hubs that are functionally connected to multiple cortical networks. We found that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain and the central lateral (CL) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei of the thalamus - regions that have historically been targeted by neuromodulatory therapies to restore consciousness - are subcortical hubs widely connected to multiple cortical networks. Further, we identified a subcortical hub in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum that overlapped with multiple reticular and extrareticular arousal nuclei and that encompassed a well-established \"hot spot\" for coma-causing brainstem lesions. Multiple hubs within the brainstem arousal nuclei and thalamic intralaminar nuclei were functionally connected to both the DMN and SN, emphasizing the importance of these cortical networks in integrative subcortico-cortical signaling. Additional subcortical connectivity hubs were observed within the caudate head, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, regions classically associated with modulation of cognition, behavior, and sensorimotor function. Collectively, these results suggest that multiple subcortical hubs in the brainstem tegmentum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe modulate cortical function in the human brain. Our findings strengthen the evidence for targeting subcortical hubs in the ventral tegmental area, central lateral thalamus, and pontomesencephalic tegmentum to restore consciousness in patients with DoC.

In the follicular epithelium of Drosophila ovaries, tricellular junctions (TCJs) open transiently in a process termed patency to allow passage of externally produced yolk proteins for uptake by the oocyte. Here we show that modulation of actomyosin contractility at cell vertices controls TCJ permeability. Before patency, circumferential actomyosin bundles are anchored at apical follicle cell vertices, where tension-sensing junctional proteins, Rho-associated kinase (Rok), and active Myosin II accumulate and maintain vertices closed. TCJ opening is initiated by redistribution of Myosin II from circumferential bundles to a medial pool, accompanied by decreasing tension on vertices. This transition requires activation of Cofilin-dependent F-actin disassembly by the phosphatase Slingshot and Myosin II inactivation by Myosin light chain phosphatase, and is counteracted by Rok. Accordingly, constitutive activation of Myosin or of Rho signaling prevent vertex opening, whereas reduced Myosin II or Rok activity cause excessive and premature vertex opening. Thus, opening of intercellular gaps in the follicular epithelium does not require actomyosin-based forces, but relies on a reduction of actomyosin contractility. Conversely, F-actin assembly is required for closing intercellular gaps after patency. Our findings are consistent with a force transduction model in which TCJ integrity is maintained by vertex-anchored contractile actomyosin. We propose that the cell-type-specific organization of actomyosin at cell vertices determines the mode of contractility-dependent regulation of epithelial permeability.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616762", "title": "Heterogeneous distribution of inhibitory inputs among motor units as a key mechanism for motor adaptations to pain", "authors": "Hug, F.; Dernoncourt, F.; Avrillon, S.; Thorstensen, J.; Besomi, M.; van den Hoorn, W.; Tucker, K.", "author_corresponding": "Francois Hug", "author_corresponding_institution": "Universite Cote d\\\\\\'Azur", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.10.05.616762.source.xml", "abstract": "Pain significantly influences movement, yet the precise neural mechanisms underlying the wide range of observed motor adaptations remain unclear. This study combined experimental data and in silico models to investigate the contribution of inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs to motor unit behaviour during submaximal contractions performed in the presence of pain. Specifically, we aimed to unravel the distribution pattern of inhibitory inputs to the motor unit pool. Seventeen participants performed isometric knee extension tasks under three conditions: Control, Pain (induced by injecting hypertonic saline into the infra-patellar fat pad), and Washout. We identified large samples of motor units in the vastus lateralis (up to 53/participant) from high-density electromyographic signals, which led to three key observations. First, while motor unit discharge rates significantly decreased during Pain, a substantial proportion of motor units (14.8-24.8%) did not show this decrease and, in some cases, even exhibited an increase. Second, using complementary approaches we showed that pain did not alter the amplification and prolongation effects of persistent inward currents on motor unit discharge, providing evidence that neuromodulatory drive to motor neurons remained unchanged. Third, we observed a significant reduction in the proportion of common inputs to motor units during Pain. To explore potential neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these experimental results, we simulated the behaviour of motor unit pools with varying distribution patterns of inhibitory inputs.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Their potential extends beyond simple language tasks, offering transformative possibilities in scientific research of all fields. By leveraging vast amounts of data and advanced computational power, LLMs can assist researchers in generating novel ideas, automating routine tasks, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. On September 12, 2024, OpenAI released their updated generative artificial intelligence system called ChatGPTo1. This new AI system, built upon chain-of-thought and reinforcement learning, has greatly enhanced logical reasoning abilities and can effectively solve various complex problems from elementary-level mathematical problems to modern scientific research issues in physics, chemistry, and biology. Unlike previous LLMs in which logical reasoning and data analysis abilities are developed through training on actual data, ChatGPTo1 logical reasoning ability and capacity to generate new scientific ideas are primarily acquired through chain-of-thought processes and reinforcement learning rather than pre-training. To examine this, we specifically tested ChatGPTo1 current reasoning and scientific discovery capabilities by developing theoretically complex and quantitatively challenging scientific equations in various fields of neuroscience, such as dynamical systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, dynamical systems on differential manifolds, neural field theory, nonlinear divergence theorems, nonlinear heat conduction equations and Laplace equations and their extensions on differential manifolds, nonlinear statistical analysis methods, deep learning, and other topics involving multiple fields. The current large language models may illustrate a certain degree of general intelligence, even if fundamentally it may be different from human intelligence. However, it does not mean the current LLMs can fully apply such ability in practical applications or that their reasoning potential can be fully tapped. It is essential to explore specific pathways and methods to cultivate their potential for scientific discovery. To accomplish this, we consider how to integrate them with common search engines (such as Google) capabilities and ChatGPT4o cross-modal abilities to better understand new disciplines and scientific discoveries. To this point, the major shortcoming of ChatGPTo1 is that it is not an end-to-end scientific discovery method and lacks the ability to achieve full automation. It also lacks methods for image analysis and full-scale data analysis, making it difficult to use simulation and data analysis to evaluate and test proposed new theories and methods.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616737", "title": "A preprocessing toolbox for 2-photon subcellular calcium imaging", "authors": "Jiang, A.; Zhao, C.; Sheffield, M.", "author_corresponding": "Mark Sheffield", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Chicago", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.10.04.616737.source.xml", "abstract": "Recording the spiking activity from subcellular compartments of neurons such as axons and dendrites during behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging is increasingly common yet remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise, inaccurate region-of-interest (ROI) identification, movement artifacts, and difficulty in grouping ROIs from the same neuron. To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient pre-processing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply band-pass filtering methods (e.g. 0.05 to 0.12 Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from z-plane movement, we apply Principal Component Analysis on all calcium traces and use a Bottom-Up Segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or k-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to \"ground truth\" data.

It is well established that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are key for creating and maintaining associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict, through Pavlovian learning. However, it remains unclear how relevant sensory information is integrated into dopamine (DA) pathways to guide exploration and learning. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is anatomically positioned as a relay for rapid sensory augmentation of dopamine neurons, which could underlie the formation of Pavlovian associations. Here, we characterize the anatomical organization and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA and SNc in rats. First, using anatomical tracing techniques, we show that neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing directly with neurons projecting to the striatum and ventral pallidum. Using fiber photometry, we find that these SC projections excite both dopamine and GABA neurons in the VTA and dopamine neurons in the SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC terminal stimulation did not reliably evoke behavior on their own in an optogenetic Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. Further, optogenetic activation of SC terminals in the VTA/SNc did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference or avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC terminals in the VTA and SNc reliably evoked head turning behavior. This body reorientation increased in intensity with repeated stimulations, suggesting that strengthening this circuit could underlie sensorimotor learning related to exploration and attentional bias.

While adult mating experience can still lead to pair-bonding and song preference learning even in birds with limited previous song exposure (\"song-naive\"), whether similarities in adult behavioral plasticity between normally-reared and song-naive females reflect convergent patterns of neural activity is unknown. We investigated this using expression of a marker of neural activity and plasticity (phosphorylated S6) in mated normally-reared and song-naive females in response to song from either their mate, a neighbor, or an unfamiliar male. We found that in portions of a secondary auditory region (the caudomedial nidopallium NCM) and in dopaminergic neurons of the caudal ventral tegmental area hearing the mate's song significantly increased pS6 expression in females from both rearing conditions. In contrast, within other NCM subregions, song-identity drove different patterns of pS6 expression depending on the rearing condition.

Biofilms are known for their electron transfer properties which are essential for metabolic processes, microbial survival, and maintaining redox balance. In this study, we investigated the electrogenic properties of Bacillus subtilis, a bacterial producer of electron-donating biofilms. Interdigitated gold electrodes were utilized to continuously measure the electrochemical activity of biofilm-forming B. subtilis cells as well as genetic mutants unable to create them (biofilm-deficient), over three days of growth. The formation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and filamentous appendages was monitored via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Chronoamperometry was used to assess electrochemical activity, which showed fluctuations in electrical current at specific time points in biofilm-forming cells. In contrast, biofilm-deficient cells showed no corresponding changes in current. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed significant differences between the voltammograms of biofilm-forming and biofilm-deficient cells that were hypothesized to be a result of the reduction of secreted flavodoxin only in biofilm-forming cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed at various intervals and analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. We identified the presence of a charge transfer resistance (Rct) exclusively in biofilm-forming cells which correlated to the time of increased electrochemical activity measured using choronoamperometry. Finally, through confocal microscopy, we found that the expression of a gene involved in biofilm matrix formation, tasA, was correlated with the time where electrochemical charge transfer was measured. Altogether, these results indicate that electrochemical activity is primarily present in biofilm-forming cells rather than in biofilm-deficient mutants. By combining electrochemical and microscopic methods, a methodology was developed to continuously monitor the stages of biofilm formation through measurement of electrochemical activity, substantiating a correlation between the expression of biofilm genes and their electrochemical or redox activities. These data show that electrochemical activities within biofilms vary over time and there is a temporal relationship between these processes and the expression of genes responsible for biofilm development.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616702", "title": "Insights into the role of phosphorylation on microtubule crosslinking by PRC1", "authors": "Tai, E.; Henglein, A.; Alfieri, A.; Saxena, G.; Forth, S.", "author_corresponding": "Scott Forth", "author_corresponding_institution": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.10.04.616702.source.xml", "abstract": "The mitotic spindle is composed of distinct networks of microtubules, including interpolar bundles that can bridge sister kinetochore fibers and bundles that organize the spindle midzone in anaphase.

We find that the wild-type construct builds longer and larger bundles that form more rapidly and are much less resistant to mechanical disruption than the phosphomimetic PRC1. Interestingly, microtubule pairs organized by both constructs behave similarly within the same assays.

Therefore, their compatibility with clinical settings is key. Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) is a two-compartment model of GM microstructure that accounts for inter-compartment exchange, whose parameter estimation requires multi-shell multi-diffusion time data. In this work, we report the first estimates of NEXI in human cortex obtained on a clinical MRI scanner. To do that, we establish an acquisition protocol and fitting routine compatible with clinical scanners. The model signal equation can be expressed either in the narrow-pulse approximation, NEXINPA, or accounting for the actual width of the diffusion gradient pulses, NEXIWP. While NEXINPA enables a faster analytical fit and is a valid approximation for data acquired on high-performance gradient systems (preclinical and Connectom scanners), on which NEXI was first implemented, NEXIWP has significant relevance for data acquired on clinical scanners with longer gradient pulses. We establish that, in the context of broad pulses, NEXIWP estimates were more comparable to previous literature values. Furthermore, we evaluate the repeatability of NEXI estimates in the human cortex on a clinical MRI scanner and show intra-subject variability to be lower than inter-subject variability, which is promising for characterizing healthy and patient cohorts. Finally, we analyze the relationship of NEXI parameters on the cortical surface to the Myelin Water Fraction (MWF), estimated using an established multicomponent T2 relaxation technique. Indeed, although it is present in small quantities in the cortex, myelin can be expected to decrease permeability.

The functional connectivity profiles of the posterior and anterior hippocampal subregions became more distinct from one another with increasing age, and age-related reductions in connectivity were strongest for the intermediate portion of the hippocampus.

E. histolytica trophozoites (amoebae) can invade the intestine and disseminate via the bloodstream, resisting complement lysis through unknown mechanisms. Amoebae kill human cells by performing trogocytosis. After performing trogocytosis, amoebae display human proteins on their own surface and are resistant to lysis by human serum. In this study we sought to further evaluate the mechanism by which amoebae resist complement. To test if complement is responsible for lysis of amoebae, C3-depleted serum was compared to replete serum, and C3 was required for lysis. Amoebae were allowed to perform trogocytosis of human cells and exposed to mouse serum. Although they had performed trogocytosis on a different species than the source of the serum, they were protected from lysis. To test if the protection from lysis by mouse serum was due to the functional interchangeability of human and mouse complement pathway proteins, human CD46 or CD55 (negative regulators of complement activation) were exogenously expressed. Amoebae that expressed human CD46 or CD55 were protected from lysis by mouse serum, indicating that display of human proteins was sufficient to inhibit mouse complement activation. Finally, amoebae were allowed to perform trogocytosis of a cell type in which the complement pathway is not conserved, and they did not become resistant to lysis. Overall, these findings are consistent with the model that trogocytosis enables amoebic acquisition and display of host proteins, including negative regulators of the complement pathway, that provide protection from complement lysis.

Although the accurate recruitment of these stress-resistant mRNAs does require the context of stress, a combination of optogenetic tools and spike-normalized ribosome profiling demonstrates that G3BPs and SGs are necessary and sufficient to both help prioritize the translation of their enriched mRNAs and help suppress cytosolic translation.

Subsequent whole genome sequencing allowed for the identification of candidate loci that correlated to lifespan differentiation. However, it remains difficult to assess whether candidate loci affect lifespan and to what extent such loci pleiotropically underpin multiple traits. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that lifespan effects of loci are often context dependent, but genotype-by-genotype interactions remain understudied.

Where these catalogs overlapped, they often disagreed on locus boundaries, hindering the comparison and reuse of results across studies. Now, with multiple groups developing public databases of TR variation in large population cohorts, there is a risk that, without sufficient consensus in the choice of locus definitions, the use of divergent repeat catalogs will lead to confusion, fragmentation, and incompatibility across future resources. In this paper, we compare existing TR catalogs and discuss desirable features of a comprehensive genome-wide catalog. We then present a new, richly annotated catalog designed for large-scale analyses and population databases. Our catalog stratifies TRs into two groups: 1) isolated TRs suitable for repeat copy number analysis using short read or long read data and 2) so-called variation clusters that contain TRs within wider polymorphic regions that are best studied through sequence-level analysis. To define variation clusters, we present a novel algorithm that leverages long-read HiFi sequencing data to group repeats with surrounding polymorphisms. We show that the human genome contains at least 25,000 complex variation clusters, most of which span over 120 bp and contain five or more TRs.

These genes were associated with nodose clusters as shown by single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and a distinct caudal-to-rostral spatial arrangement was presented as delineated by spatial transcriptomics. The distinct clusters closely match previous identification of nodose neuron clusters. Correspondingly, the lung transcriptome was altered with asthmatic induction such that transcripts associated with neural excitation were upregulated. The spatial distribution of these transcripts was revealed by spatial transcriptomics to illustrate that these were expressed in neuroendocrine-like cells/club cells, and neurons.

Theoretical work suggests the antagonistic pleiotropy between life stages can generate balancing selection and maintain genetic variation.

However, it is unclear how the evolutionary history of ancestral generations with chronic malnutrition could influence pathogen resistance and infection susceptibility, as well as their age-specific changes in extant generations. To address this, we used Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted against chronic juvenile malnutrition and exposed them to a bacterial pathogen, Providencia rettgeri, during their early and late adulthood. Surprisingly, we observed that in populations adapted to chronic malnutrition, young flies survived infection better by tolerating the infection, while control flies displayed higher infection susceptibility despite carrying a similar pathogen load.

The SEAC is composed of two subcomplexes, SEACIT, an inhibitor of TORC1 that contains the GAP activity, and SEACAT, that has been proposed to regulate the activity of SEACIT. However, molecular details of its regulation are unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SEAC-EGOC supercomplex and studied its function in TORC1 amino acid signalling. A single SEAC can interact with two EGOC molecules via SEACIT, binding exclusively to the \"active\" version of the EGOC as their interaction depends on Gtr1 being loaded with GTP. SEACAT does not modulate nor interact with the EGOC. The GAP activity of the SEAC is essential for the regulation of TORC1 by amino acids, and its loss phenocopies the lack of Gtr1-Gtr2, establishing the SEAC-EGOC complex as an amino acid-sensing hub. Despite being located far from the active site, deletion of Sea2, or its N-terminal {beta}-propeller domain, also results in defects in amino acid signalling to TORC1. We propose that the SEAC-EGOC supercomplex integrates coatomer-like mechanisms of regulation via bidirectional feedback between GAP-GTPase (SEACIT-EGOC) and coat (SEACAT) modules that explain the functional interaction between Sea2 and the GAP activity.

Inactivating mutations of XPR1 lead to brain calcifications causing neurological symptoms that include migraine, movements disorders, psychosis, and dementia. Distinct cryo-electron microscopy structures of dimeric XPR1 and functional characterization define the substrate translocation pathway and delineate how binding of InsP8 initiates the transport cycle.

Together, these findings advance our understanding of XPR1 transport activity and expand opportunities for rationalizing disease mechanisms and therapeutic intervention.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616725", "title": "ADT-1004: A First-in-Class, Orally Bioavailable Selective pan-RAS Inhibitor for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma", "authors": "El-Rayes, B.

ADT-1004 strongly blocked tumor growth and RAS activation in mouse PDAC models without discernable toxicity. As evidence of target engagement and tumor specificity, ADT-1004 inhibited activated RAS and ERK phosphorylation in PDAC tumors at dosages approximately 10-fold below the maximum tolerated dose and without discernable toxicity. ADT-1004 inhibited ERK phosphorylation in PDAC tumors. In addition, ADT-1004 blocked tumor growth and ERK phosphorylation in PDX PDAC models with KRASG12D, KRASG12V, KRASG12C, or KRASG13Q mutations. ADT-1004 treatment increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the TME consistent with exhaustion and increased MHCII+ M1 macrophage and dendritic cells. ADT-1004 demonstrated superior efficacy over sotorasib and adagrasib in tumor models involving human PDAC cells resistant to these KRASG12C inhibitors. As evidence of selectivity for tumors from PDAC cells with mutant KRAS, ADT-1004 did not impact the growth of tumors from RASWT PDAC cells. Displaying broad antitumor activity in multiple mouse models of PDAC, along with target engagement and selectivity at dosages that were well tolerated, ADT-1004 warrants further development.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616708", "title": "Gum Arabic (Acacia senegal) enhances reproduction and modulates the microbiota-gut-brain axis of zebrafish in a sex-specific and dosage-dependent manner", "authors": "Abi Assaf, J.; de Coriolis, J.-C.; Godden, A.

Gum Arabic (GA) is a tree exudate consisting of 90% arabinogalactan, a polymer of arabinose and galactose sugars with prebiotic properties. As a dietary fibre, GA improves renal function, metabolism, and immune response in humans and animals. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to these health benefits are poorly understood. We supplemented female and male zebrafish (Danio rerio) with two concentrations of GA (6% and 60%) for two weeks. We assessed the effects of GA supplementation on the gut microbiome composition, intestinal and brain metabolic profiles, reproductive fitness, and brain gene expression. We found that GA supplementation resulted in changes to the gut microbiome with a relative increase in Fusobacteria and a relative decrease in Proteobacteria where the beneficial genus Cetobacterium was significantly more abundant after supplementation. GA supplementation increased acetate levels, particularly in the brain, causing a decreased expression of cart1 in the brain of female zebrafish. While GA supplementation increased overall activity in male and female fish, reproductive fitness was negatively affected by GA supplementation in females. Our results suggest that while GA supplementation may have positive effects on metabolic rate and overall activity, it may come at a trade-off with reproductive fitness.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616739", "title": "Deep Mining of the Human Antibody Repertoire Identifies Frequent and Immunogenetically Diverse CDRH3 Topologies Targetable by Vaccination", "authors": "Habib, R.; Solieva, S.

The V2 apex of the HIV-1 Env protein is a promising target for a class of bnAbs that contain conserved structural motifs in the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3). Here, we show that these structural motifs are targetable by vaccination by characterizing V2 apex \"axe-like\" CDRH3s in the human repertoire and developing new immunogens capable of selectively engaging them. We determined the frequency and diversity of axe-like CDHR3s in healthy human donors using a series of structural informatics approaches finding these precursors in 86.5% of donors. Axe-targeting immunogens based on the HIV-1 Env Q23.17 were developed and bound axe-like precursors in cryo-EM structures, induced V2 apex-specific antibody responses in humanized mice, and induced axe-like heterologous neutralizing antibodies in rhesus macaques. These results unveil a new structure-guided immunoinformatic vaccine design paradigm that can be employed to elicit immunogenetically diverse yet structurally conserved classes of antibodies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616721", "title": "The N-terminus of YY1 regulates DNA and RNA binding affinity for both the zinc-fingers and an unexpected nucleic acid binding domain", "authors": "Elias, J.; Rosin, J.

Beyond their well-folded DNA binding domains (DBDs) which recognize cognate DNA elements in the genome, TFs are enriched for intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which have a host of proposed functions including facilitating protein-protein interactions, aiding in binding site search, and binding RNA. Defining intrinsic regulatory properties of TFs requires further mechanistic investigation. We chose to investigate the DNA and RNA binding properties of Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a ubiquitously expressed TF directly involved in transcriptional activation, repression and genome architecture. Through systematic in vitro nucleic acid binding experiments we resolve conflicting literature defining the RNA binding interface of YY1, demonstrating that there are two RNA binding domains within YY1: its canonical 4 zinc finger DBD and a previously unannotated nucleic acid binding domain, which we term the REPO-NAB. Furthermore, we discover surprising autoinhibitory properties that the N-terminus of the protein imparts on each of these binding domains.

Neurological complications of severe (>40{degrees}C) fever have been associated with increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability due to structural disruption, while little is known about brain physiology of moderate fever. Here, we show that a temperature increase to 39-40{degrees}C triggers fluid-phase uptake in PC12 cells and primary neurons. Uptake of selective cargoes shows that clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis are induced in a translation-dependent manner, consistent with a role for heat shock response. Exocytic recycling is also increased by hyperthermia, suggesting a comprehensive boost of membrane trafficking. Mild (<39{degrees}C) whole-body hyperthermia in vivo boosts fluid-phase uptake in various organs, notably enabling brain accumulation of an intravenously injected antibody that is blocked by dynamin inhibition. Taken together, our findings show that fever systemically regulates membrane trafficking across the body, reveal dynamin-dependent endocytosis as an innate cell biological mechanism for temperature control of BBB permeability, and demonstrate a clinical potential of mild hyperthermia for facilitating brain delivery of biologic drugs.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616749", "title": "Structural basis for a nucleoporin exportin complex between RanBP2, SUMO1-RanGAP1, the E2 Ubc9, Crm1 and the Ran GTPase", "authors": "Baytshtok, V.; DiMattia, M.

In mitosis, RanBP2/SUMO1-RanGAP1/Ubc9 remains intact after NPC disassembly and is recruited to kinetochores and mitotic spindles by Crm1 where it contributes to mitotic progression. Interestingly, RanBP2 binds SUMO1-RanGAP1/Ubc9 with motifs that also catalyze SUMO E3 ligase activity. Here, we resolve cryo-EM structures of a RanBP2 C-terminal fragment bound to Crm1, SUMO1-RanGAP1/Ubc9, and two molecules of Ran(GTP), one bound to Crm1 and the other bound to RanGAP1 and RanBP2. These structures reveal several unanticipated interactions with Crm1 including a nuclear export signal (NES) for RanGAP1, the deletion of which mislocalizes RanGAP1 and the Ran GTPase in cells. Our structural and biochemical results support models in which RanBP2 E3 ligase activity is dependent on Crm1, the RanGAP1 NES and Ran GTPase cycling.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}]}
