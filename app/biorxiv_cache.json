The molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells coopt neighboring adipocytes, however, remain elusive. Here, we describe a direct interaction linking tumorigenesis to adjacent adipocytes. We examine breast tumors and their normal adjacent tissue from several patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse models, and find that lipolysis and lipolytic signaling are activated in neighboring adipose tissue. We find that functional gap junctions form between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. As a result, cAMP is transferred from breast cancer cells to adipocytes and activates lipolysis in a gap junction-dependent manner. We identify connexin 31 (GJB3), which promotes receptor triple negative breast cancer growth and activation of lipolysis in vivo. Thus, direct tumor cell-adipocyte interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and may serve as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.\n\nOne sentence summaryGap junctions between breast cancer cells and adipocytes transfer cAMP and activate lipolysis in the breast tumor microenvironment to support growth.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/314658", "title": "A miRNA screen identifies a transcriptional program controlling the fate of adult stem cell", "authors": "Robert, J.; Vlachavas, E.-I.; Lemaitre, G.; Chatziioannou, A.; Puceat, M.; Delom, F.; Fessart, D.", "author_corresponding": "Delphine  Fessart", "author_corresponding_institution": "Univ. of Bordeaux", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "5", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "cell biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/314658.source.xml", "abstract": "The 3D cultures provide more insight into cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions, better mimicking the environment where stem cells reside compared to traditional 2D cultures.

Cul3 engages dozens of adaptor proteins to recruit hundreds of substrates for ubiquitination, but the adaptors that impact sleep and synapses remain ill-defined. Here we implicate Insomniac (Inc), a conserved protein required for normal sleep and synaptic homeostasis in Drosophila, as a Cul3 adaptor. Inc binds Cul3 in vivo, and mutations within the N-terminal BTB domain of Inc that weaken Inc-Cul3 associations impair Inc activity, indicating that Inc function requires binding to the Cul3 complex. Deletion of the conserved C-terminus of Inc does not alter Cul3 binding but abolishes Inc activity in the context of sleep and synaptic homeostasis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of Inc is a substrate recruitment domain. Mutation of a conserved, disease-associated arginine in the Inc C-terminus also abolishes Inc function, suggesting that this residue is vital for recruiting Inc targets. Inc levels are negatively regulated by Cul3 in neurons, consistent with Inc degradation by autocatalytic ubiquitination, a hallmark of Cullin adaptors. These findings link Inc and Cul3 in vivo and indicate that Cul3-Inc complexes are essential for normal sleep and synaptic function. Furthermore, these results indicate that dysregulation of conserved substrates of Cul3-Inc complexes may contribute to altered sleep and synaptic function in autism and schizophrenia associated with Cul3 mutations.\n\nAuthor SummaryCul3 is a highly conserved gene important for brain development and function. Cul3 mutations are a risk factor for autism and schizophrenia, neurological disorders associated with disturbed sleep and changes in neuronal synapses. A key challenge in understanding how Cul3 impacts brain function is elucidating the downstream molecular pathways. Cul3 is a ubiquitin ligase that assembles with dozens of adaptor proteins, which in turn recruit specific protein substrates for ubiquitination. Identifying and characterizing Cul3 adaptors in the nervous system is thus a critical step in understanding Cul3 function. Because Cul3 and its adaptors are conserved through evolution, simpler organisms including the fruit fly Drosophila provide powerful systems for identifying and characterizing Cul3 adaptors. We found that the Insomniac (Inc) protein has the properties of a Cul3 adaptor that impacts sleep and synaptic function in Drosophila. These results suggest that human proteins related to Inc may be relevant for changes in sleep and synaptic function in autism and schizophrenia associated with reduced Cul3 activity.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2020.01.27.921262", "title": "Breast cancer-secreted factors induce atrophy and reduce basal and insulinstimulated glucose uptake by inhibiting Rac1 activation in rat myotubes", "authors": "Ali, M.

Metabolic disorders are prevalent in women with breast cancer, increasing mortality and cancer recurrence rates. Despite clinical implications, the cause of breast cancerassociated metabolic dysfunction remains poorly understood. Skeletal muscle is crucial for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, thus key to whole-body glucose homeostasis. In this study, we determined the effect of breast cancer cell-conditioned media on skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to insulin. Method. L6 myotubes overexpressing myc-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4myc-L6) were incubated with 40% conditioned media from tumorigenic MCF7 or BT474, or non-tumorigenic control MCF10A breast cells. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics was applied to detect molecular rewiring in response to breast cancer in the muscle. Expression of myogenesis and inflammation markers, GLUT4 translocation, [3H]-2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake, and intramyocellular insulin signalling were determined. Results. Breast cancer cell-conditioned media induced proteomic changes in pathways related to sarcomere organisation, actin filament binding, and vesicle trafficking, disrupted myogenic differentiation, activated an inflammatory response via NF-{kappa}B, and induced muscle atrophy. Basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and 2DG uptake were reduced in myotubes treated with breast cancer cell-conditioned media compared to the control. Insulin signalling via the Rho GTPase Rac1 was blocked in breast cancer-treated myotubes, while Akt-TBC1D4 signalling was unaffected. Conclusion. Conditioned media from MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake via inhibition of GLUT4 translocation and intramyocellular insulin signalling by selectively blocking Rac1 activation and inducing inflammation. These findings indicate that the rewiring of skeletal muscle proteome, inflammation, and insulin signalling could play a role in metabolic dysfunction in patients with breast cancer.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2020.10.21.349050", "title": "An H3-K9-me-independent binding of Swi6/HP1 to siRNA-DNA hybrids initiates heterochromatin assembly at cognate dg-dh repeats in Fission Yeast", "authors": "Singh, J.; Kumar, J.; Haldar, S.; Gupta, N.; Kumar, V.; Thakur, M.; Chandradoss, K.

Subsequent self-association of Swi6/HP1 on adjacent nucleosomes or a cooperative interaction between Clr4 and Swi6/HP1 leads to folded heterochromatin structure. HP1 binding to RNA is shown to facilitate its localization at and assembly of heterochromatin in metazoans. Likewise, recruitment of Swi6/HP1 to centromere depends on the RNAi pathway in fission yeast; paradoxically, Swi6/HP1 is also thought to play a role in RNA turnover. Here we provide evidence in support of RNAi-independent recruitment of Swi6. We show that, apart from the low affinity binding to RNAs through its hinge domain, as already reported, Swi6/HP1 displays a hierarchy of increasing binding affinity through its chromodomain to the siRNAs corresponding to specific dg-dh repeats and even stronger binding to the cognate siRNA-DNA hybrids than to the siRNA precursors or general RNAs. Our results support a mechanism of recruitment of Swi6, which is dependent on its specific and high affinity binding to siRNA-DNA hybrid at the dg-dh repeats. This binding, which is independent of, albeit augmented by binding to H3-K9-Me2, leads to heterochromatin formation and silencing. We suggest that the net role of Swi6 in RNA physiology may be regulated by a balance between abundance and affinity of Swi6 towards heterochromatic and euchromatic RNAs and siRNAs.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2021.03.14.435303", "title": "BEdeepon: an in silico tool for prediction of base editor efficiencies and outcomes", "authors": "Zhang, C.; Yu, Z.; Wang, D.; Qi, T.; Zhang, Y.; Hou, L.; Lan, F.; Yang, J.; Shi, L.; Ong, S.-G.; Wang, H.; Wang, Y.", "author_corresponding": "Yongming  Wang", "author_corresponding_institution": "Fudan University", "date": "2024-10-08", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "bioinformatics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/08/2021.03.14.435303.source.xml", "abstract": "Base editors enable direct conversion of one target base into another in a programmable manner, but conversion efficiencies vary dramatically among different targets.

Here, we transformed a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and studied it under environmental conditions prevalent on early Earth. Using this approach, we successfully reconstructed morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils. In addition to reproducing microfossil morphologies, we conducted experiments that spanned years to understand the process of cell degradation and how Archaean cells could have undergone encrustation minerals (in this case, salt), leading to their preservation as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record. These degradation products strongly resemble fossiliferous features from Archaean rock formations. Our observations suggest that microfossils aged between 3.8 to 2.5Ga most likely were liposome-like protocells that have evolved physiological pathways of energy conservation but not the mechanisms to regulate their morphology.

Due to the complexity of the brain, it is impractical to include all microscopic details in a simulation. Hence, researchers often simulate the brain as a network of coupled neural masses, each described by a mean-field model. These models capture the essential features of neuronal populations while approximating most biophysical details. However, it may be important to include certain parameters that significantly impact brain function. The concentration of ions in the extracellular space is one key factor to consider, as its fluctuations can be associated with healthy and pathological brain states. In this paper, we develop a new mean-field model of a population of Hodgkin-Huxley-type neurons, retaining a microscopic perspective on the ion-exchange mechanisms driving neuronal activity. This allows us to maintain biophysical interpretability while bridging the gap between micro and macro-scale mechanisms. Our model is able to reproduce a wide range of activity patterns, also observed in large neural network simulations. Specifically, slow-changing ion concentrations modulate the fast neuroelectric activity, a feature of our model that we validated through in vitro experiments.

Host cell remodeling depends on the export of different classes of exported parasite proteins into the infected red blood cell (RBC). Here we show that members of a recently discovered group of difficult to predict exported proteins harbor an N-terminal export domain, similar to other classes of exported proteins, indicating that this is a common theme among all classes of exported proteins. For one such protein, MSRP6 (MSP-7 related protein 6), we identified a second, untypical export-mediating domain that corresponded to its MSP7-like region. In addition to its function in export, this domain also mediated attachment to the Maurers clefts, prominent parasite-induced structures in the host cell where MSRP6 is located. Using BioID with the Maurers clefts attachment domain of MSRP6 to identify interactors and compartment neighbors in live parasites we discovered a novel complex of proteins at the Maurers clefts. We show that this complex is necessary for the anchoring and maintaining the structural integrity of the Maurers clefts. The Maurers clefts are believed to be involved in the transport of the major virulence factor PfEMP1 to the host cell surface where it mediates cytoadherence of infected RBCs to endothelial cells, a main reason for the importance of host cell modifications for parasite virulence in the human host. Taking advantage of MSRP6 complex mutants and IT4 parasites that we modified to express only one specific PfEMP1 we find that abolishing Maurers clefts anchoring was neither needed for PfEMP1 transport to the host cell surface nor for cytoadherence.

Published ChIP-seq datasets show SATB1 binding to highly accessible chromatin at enhancers and CTCF sites, but not to BURs. By employing urea ChIP-seq, which retains only directly bound protein:DNA complexes, we found that BURs, but not CTCF sites, are direct SATB1 binding targets. SATB1-bound BUR interactions with accessible chromatin can cross multiple topologically associated domains (TADs) and SATB1 is required for these megabase-scale interactions linked to cell type-specific gene expression. BURs are mainly found within lamina associated domains (LADs) sequestered at the nuclear lamina, but also in inter-LADs, and SATB1 binds a subset of BURs depending on cell type. Notably, despite the mutually exclusive SATB1-binding profiles uncovered by the two ChIP-seq methods, we found most peaks in both profiles are real and require SATB1.

However, to fully utilize the potential of game-theoretical modelling in designing better anti-cancer therapies, we need more information on cancer population (ecological) and strategy (evolutionary) dynamics in response to treatment for each patient and their tumors. Here we explore how transcriptomics data can be utilized as an input of game-theoretical models for predicting evolutionary response to irradiation in patient-derived glioblastoma organoids. For that purpose, we utilize both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to identify relevant cancer cell types and how their proportions change over time in the organoids. We then fit these proportions to the replicator dynamics, the most common evolutionary game dynamics, to predict both transient evolutionary dynamics and evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) cell proportions. Our predictions in glioblastoma organoids suggest that hypoxia is the most important factor in identifying short-term response to irradiation, while this seems much less relevant for the long-term response corresponding to the ESSs. Further, we conclude that supervised methods are the best way to estimate cancer evolutionary dynamics when therapy resistance is a qualitative evolutionary trait. We believe that our methodology can help in designing better therapies through testing evolutionary responses in patient-derived organoids, while in parallel the ecological response can be tracked through serum biomarkers and imaging in the corresponding patients.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.03.09.483541", "title": "Odors drive feeding through gustatory receptor neurons in Drosophila", "authors": "Wei, H.-p.; Lam, T.

Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not olfactory organs. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording show that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER and food consumption.

The grandmother hypothesis and its variation the live long hypothesis are untenable; the former requires \"climbing a steep fitness hill\", as grandmothers share only 25% of their genes with their grandchildren, compared to 50% with their direct offspring, while the latter proposes a prolongation of the post-menopausal lifespan through selection, which is impossible in a population of non-reproducing females. The mate choice theory explains menopause as the result of asymmetric mating involving younger females and older males that leads to an accumulation of infertility mutations and the evolution of menopause in older females. In this study, we investigated the mate choice theory using an infertility mutation accumulation experiment with Drosophila melanogaster that involved mating between individuals of different age groups. After 70 generations of asymmetric mating, the results showed that younger females who were paired with older males showed declining fertility in old age. The same trend was noted with younger males when mated with older females; the fertility of the males declined in old age. These results support the mate choice theory and indicate that menopause is not a life history trait of females but of the sex of the younger mate. Mate choice theory treats the evolution of menopause and post-menopausal lifespan as independent traits that are driven by the mate choices exercised by older males. Menopause may be an atypical process because the evolutionary mechanism (age-restricted asymmetric mating) involved is rarely observed.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.05.24.493217", "title": "Dendritic growth and synaptic organization from activity-independent cues and local activity-dependent plasticity", "authors": "Kirchner, J.

How they emerge simultaneously during brain development as neurons become integrated into functional networks is still not mechanistically understood. Here, we propose a mechanistic model in which dendrite growth and the organization of synapses arise from the interaction of activity-independent cues from potential synaptic partners and local activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Consistent with experiments, three phases of dendritic growth - overshoot, pruning, and stabilization - emerge naturally in the model. The model generates stellate-like dendritic morphologies that capture several morphological features of biological neurons under normal and perturbed learning rules, reflecting biological variability. Model-generated dendrites have approximately optimal wiring length consistent with experimental measurements. In addition to establishing dendritic morphologies, activity-dependent plasticity rules organize synapses into spatial clusters according to the correlated activity they experience. We demonstrate that a trade-off between activity-dependent and -independent factors influences dendritic growth and synaptic location throughout development, suggesting that early developmental variability can affect mature morphology and synaptic function. Therefore, a single mechanistic model can capture dendritic growth and account for the synaptic organization of correlated inputs during development. Our work suggests concrete mechanistic components underlying the emergence of dendritic morphologies and synaptic formation and removal in function and dysfunction, and provides experimentally testable predictions for the role of individual components.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.05.31.494145", "title": "SAM-dependent viral MTase inhibitors: herbacetin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester, structural insights into dengue MTase", "authors": "Bhutkar, M.; Kumar, A.; Rani, R.; Singh, V.; Pathak, A.; Kothiala, A.; Mahajan, S.; Waghmode, B.; Kumar, R.; Mudgal, R.; Sircar, D.; Kumar, P.; Tomar, S.", "author_corresponding": "Shailly  Tomar", "author_corresponding_institution": "Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "5", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2022.05.31.494145.source.xml", "abstract": "Chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses pose a public health risk and lack antiviral treatment.

We compared DNA methylation in N=16 individuals with high (>10 g/g) vs. N=16 individuals with low (<1 g/g) total hair mercury (a proxy for methylmercury exposure), matched on age and sex.\n\nResultsWe identified nine differentially methylated CpG sites (FDR<0.05), including several with known links to MeHg toxicity. The most significantly different CpG site was in an intronic enhancer of the SLC5A7 gene, which encodes the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) that facilitates MeHg transport into protein-rich tissue, including muscle and brain. Our Gene Ontology and transcription factor motif enrichment analyses identified differential methylation of genes involved in several outcomes with established links to MeHg, including immune response, neurotoxicity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Last, we identified candidate epigenetic biomarkers of PUFA-mediated protection against MeHg toxicity.\n\nDiscussionHere, we show that a small EWAS on samples with high MeHg exposure variance can detect candidate differentially methylated CpGs and pathways of interest relevant to MeHg biology.

Two-photon optogenetics has been shown to be a promising technology for mapping such monosynaptic connections via serial stimulation of neurons with single-cell resolution. However, this approach is limited in its ability to uncover connectivity at large scales because stimulating neurons one-by-one requires prohibitively long experiments. Here we developed novel computational tools that, when combined, enable learning of monosynaptic connectivity from high-speed holographic neural ensemble stimulation. First, we developed a model-based compressed sensing algorithm that identifies connections from postsynaptic responses evoked by stimulation of many neurons at once, considerably increasing the rate at which the existence and strength of synapses are screened. We show that this model-based approach, explicitly incorporating known biophysics of optogenetic mapping experiments, is critical for accurately determining synaptic connectivity using compressed sensing. Second, we developed a deep learning method that isolates the postsynaptic response evoked by each stimulus, allowing stimulation to rapidly switch between ensembles without waiting for the postsynaptic response to return to baseline. We then validated our approach by performing large-scale connectivity mapping experiments in slices from layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex. Together, our system increases the throughput of monosynaptic connectivity mapping by an order of magnitude over existing approaches, enabling the acquisition of connectivity maps at speeds needed to discover the synaptic circuitry implementing neural computations.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.09.26.509455", "title": "Aminoglycoside tolerance in Vibrio cholerae engages translational reprogramming associated with queuosine tRNA modification", "authors": "Fruchard, L.; Babosan, A.; Carvalho, A.; Lang, M.; Li, B.; Duchateau, M.; Giai Gianetto, Q.; Matondo, M.; Bonhomme, F.; Hatin, I.; Arbes, H.; Fabret, C.; Corler, E.; Sanchez, G.; MArchand, V.; Motorine, Y.; NAMY, O.; de Crecy-Lagard, V.; Mazel, D.; Baharoglu, Z.", "author_corresponding": "Zeynep Baharoglu", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institut Pasteur", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "4", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nd", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2022.09.26.509455.source.xml", "abstract": "Tgt is the enzyme modifying the guanine (G) in tRNAs with GUN anticodon to queuosine (Q). tgt is required for optimal growth of Vibrio cholerae in the presence of sub-lethal aminoglycoside concentrations.

We obtained DNA methylation signatures at the gene and biological function level, identifying those significant groups of genes and functional pathways affected. To achieve this, we conducted a thorough systematic review following PRISMA statement guidelines for the selection of studies on DNA methylation in breast cancer. In total, we gathered four studies (GSE52865, GSE141338, GSE59901 and GSE101443) that were split into 13 comparisons comprising a set of 144 individuals. We discovered that most breast cancer subtypes share a significant deregulation in the immune system and alterations to the cell cycle.

Due to the challenge of specifically interfering with oscillatory network dynamics in neuronal systems, we simulated recurrent networks (RNNs) of damped harmonic oscillators in which oscillatory activity is enforced in each node, a choice well-supported by experimental findings. When trained on standard pattern recognition tasks, these harmonic oscillator networks (HORNs) outperformed non-oscillatory architectures with respect to learning speed, noise tolerance, and parameter efficiency. HORNs also reproduced a substantial number of characteristic features of neuronal systems such as the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. In trained HORNs, stimulus-induced interference patterns holistically represent the result of comparing sensory evidence with priors stored in recurrent connection weights, and learning-induced weight changes are compatible with Hebbian principles. Implementing additional features characteristic of natural networks, such as heterogeneous oscillation frequencies, inhomogeneous conduction delays, and network modularity, further enhanced HORN performance without requiring additional parameters. Taken together, our model allows us to give plausible a posteriori explanations for features of natural networks whose computational role has remained elusive. We conclude that neuronal systems are likely to exploit the unique dynamics of recurrent oscillators networks whose computational superiority critically depends on the oscillatory patterning of their nodal dynamics.

Cell size and shape have been informative in defining macrophage subtypes. Studies show pro and anti-inflammatory macrophages exhibit distinct migratory behaviors, in vitro, in 3D and in vivo but this link has not been rigorously studied. We apply both morphology and motility-based image processing approaches to analyze live cell images consisting of macrophage phenotypes. Macrophage subtypes are differentiated from primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages using a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). We show that morphology is tightly linked to motility, which leads to our hypothesis that motility analysis could be used alone or in conjunction with morphological features for improved prediction of macrophage subtypes. We train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict macrophage subtypes based on morphology alone, motility alone, and both morphology and motility combined. We show that motility has comparable predictive capabilities as morphology. However, using both measures can enhance predictive capabilities. While motility and morphological features can be individually ambiguous identifiers, together they provide significantly improved prediction accuracies (75%) from a training dataset of 1000 cells tracked over time using only phase contrast time-lapse microscopy. Thus, the approach combining cell motility and cell morphology information can lead to methods that accurately assess functionally diverse macrophage phenotypes quickly and efficiently. This can support the development of cost efficient and high through-put methods for screening biochemicals targeting macrophage polarization.\n\nAuthor summaryPrevious work has shown that macrophage phenotypes can be distinguished by their morphological characteristics. We extend this work to show that distinct motility patterns are linked to macrophage morphology. Thus, motility patterns can be used to differentiate phenotypes. This can enable high-throughput classification of cell phenotypes without regard for the high-resolution images needed to quantify morphological characteristics. Furthermore, combining motility-based features with morphological information improves prediction of macrophage subtypes by a machine learning based classification model.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2022.12.02.518902", "title": "Like mother, like daughter?

The giant ciliate Stentor coeruleus is a unicellular model organism whose large size, reproducible structure, and ability to heal wounds and regenerate have historically allowed the formation of structure in a single cell to be addressed using methods of experimental embryology. Such studies have shown that specific cellular structures, such as the membranellar band, always form in particular regions of the cell, which raises the question: what is the source of positional information within this organism? By analogy with embryonic development, in which regionalized mRNA is often used to mark position, we asked whether specific regionalized mRNAs might mark position along the anterior-posterior axis of Stentor. By physically bisecting cells and conducting bulk RNA sequencing, we were able to identify sets of messages enriched in either the anterior or posterior half. We then conducted half-cell RNA-sequencing in paired anteriors and posteriors of cells in which the microtubule cytoskeleton was disrupted by RNAi of beta-tubulin or dynein intermediate chains. We found that many messages either lost their regionalized distribution or switched to an opposite distribution, such that anterior-enriched messages in control became posterior-enriched in the RNAi cells, or vice versa.

We demonstrate that PRDM16 regulates the genomic distribution of BMP pathway transcription factors, the SMAD4/pSMAD complex, preventing the activation of cell proliferation genes.

In human cells, it depends on the binding to chromatin of various proteins, including RNA polymerases and numerous transcription factors (TFs). Observations indicate that these proteins tend to form macromolecular clusters, known as transcription factories, whose morphology and composition is still debated. While some microscopy experiments have revealed the presence of specialised factories, composed of similar TFs transcribing families of related genes, sequencing experiments suggest instead that mixed clusters may be prevalent, as a panoply of different TFs binds promiscuously the same chromatin region. The mechanisms underlying the formation of specialised or mixed factories remain elusive. With the aim of finding such mechanisms, here we develop a chromatin polymer model mimicking the chromatin binding-unbinding dynamics of different types of complexes of TFs. Surprisingly, both specialised (i.e., demixed) and mixed clusters spontaneously emerge, and which of the two types forms depends mainly on cluster size. The mechanism promoting mixing is the presence of non-specific interactions between chromatin and proteins, which become increasingly important as clusters become larger. This result, that we observe both in simple polymer models and more realistic ones for human chromosomes, reconciles the apparently contrasting experimental results obtained.

We have now dissected mycolactones effects on primary vascular endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. We show that mycolactone-induced changes in endothelial morphology, adhesion, migration, and permeability are dependent on its action at the Sec61 translocon. Unbiased quantitative proteomics identified a profound effect on proteoglycans, driven by rapid loss of type II transmembrane proteins of the Golgi, including enzymes required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis, combined with a reduction in the core proteins themselves. Loss of the glycocalyx is likely to be of particular mechanistic importance, since knockdown of galactosyltransferase II (beta-1,3-galactotransferase 6; B3GALT6), the GAG linker-building enzyme, phenocopied the permeability and phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone. Additionally, mycolactone depleted many secreted basement membrane components and microvascular basement membranes were disrupted in vivo. Remarkably, exogenous addition of laminin-511 reduced endothelial cell rounding, restored cell attachment and reversed the defective migration caused by mycolactone.

Synaptic-weight-based Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling were considered the key mechanisms in enabling memory while stabilizing network dynamics. However, the role of structural plasticity as a homeostatic mechanism is less consistently reported, especially under activity inhibition, leading to an incomplete understanding of its functional impact. In this study, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGPF-labeled neurons in organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures with computational modeling to investigate the response of spine-number-based structural plasticity to activity perturbations and its interaction with homeostatic synaptic scaling. Tracking individual dendritic segments, we demonstrated that inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission does not monotonically regulate dendritic spine density. Specifically, inhibition of AMPA receptors with a low concentration of 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX, 200 nM) significantly increased spine density, while complete AMPA receptors blockade with 50 M NBQX reduced spine density. Motivated by these findings, we developed network simulations incorporating a bi-phasic structural plasticity rule governing activity-dependent synapse formation. We showed that this biphasic rule maintained neural activity homeostasis under stimulation and permitted either synapse formation or synapse loss, depending on the degree of activity deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling affected the recurrent connectivity, modulated the network activity, and influenced the outcome of structural plasticity. Specifically, it reduced stimulation-triggered synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights and rescued silencing-induced synapse loss by upscaling recurrent inputs, thus reactivating silent neurons. Our interaction between these mechanisms offers an explanation for divergent findings in the existing literature. In summary, calcium-based synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity rules compete and compensate for one another, ensuring efficient and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.03.09.531726", "title": "Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex Functional Connectivity Abnormalities in Depression: Insights from Brain Imaging Big Data and Precision-Guided Personalized Intervention via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "authors": "Chen, X.; Lu, B.; Wang, Y.-W.; Li, X.-Y.; Wang, Z.-H.; Li, H.-X.; Liao, Y.-F.; Blumberger, D.

There are now several open-source tools for tracking laboratory animals, but often these are only accurate under limited conditions (e.g. uniform lighting and background, uncluttered scenes, unobstructed focal animal). Tracking fish presents a particular challenge for these tools because movement at the waters surface introduces significant noise. Partial occlusion of the focal animal can also be troublesome, particularly when tracking the whole organism. But identifying the position of an animal is only part of the task - analysing the movement of the animal relative to their environment and experimental context is often what provides information about their behaviour. Therefore, the automated detection of physical objects and boundaries would also be beneficial, but this feature is not commonly incorporated into existing tracking software. Here we describe a video processing method that uses a range of computer vision algorithms (e.g. object detector and tracker, optical flow, parallel plane homology) and computational geometry techniques (e.g. Voronoi tessellation) to analyse the movement behaviour of fish in response to experimental stimuli. A behavioural experiment, which involved tracking a fishs trajectory through a field of obstacles, motivated our development of a set of tools that: (1) measure an animals trajectory, (2) record obstacle position, and (3) detect when the fish passed through  virtual gates between adjacent obstacles and/or the aquarium wall. We have introduced a novel Detect+Track approach that significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of animal tracking, overcoming some of the limitations of existing tools and providing a more reliable solution for complex experimental conditions. Our workflow is divided into several discrete steps, and provides a set of modular software building blocks that can be adapted to analyse other experimental designs.

Rodent research shows prominent low theta ([~]3-6 Hz), high theta ([~]6-12 Hz), and gamma (>30 Hz) rhythms in the BLA local field potential recordings. However, it is not understood what role these rhythms play in supporting the plasticity. Here, we create a biophysically detailed model of the BLA circuit to show that several classes of interneurons (PV, SOM, and VIP) in the BLA can be critically involved in producing the rhythms; these rhythms promote the formation of a dedicated fear circuit shaped through spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Each class of interneurons is necessary for the plasticity. We find that the low theta rhythm is a biomarker of successful fear conditioning. The model makes use of interneurons commonly found in the cortex and, hence, may apply to a wide variety of associative learning situations.\n\nSignificanceOur paper accounts for the experimental evidence showing that amygdalar rhythms exist, suggests network origins for these rhythms, and points to their central role in the mechanisms of plasticity involved in associative learning. It is one of the few papers to address high-order cognition with biophysically detailed models, which are sometimes thought to be too detailed to be adequately constrained. Our paper provides a template for how to use information about brain rhythms to constrain biophysical models. It shows in detail, for the first time, how multiple interneurons help to provide time scales necessary for some kinds of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). It spells out the conditions under which such interactions between interneurons are needed for STDP and why. Finally, our work helps to provide a framework by which some of the discrepancies in the fear learning literature might be reevaluated. In particular, we discuss issues about Hebbian plasticity in fear learning; we show in the context of our model how neuromodulation might resolve some of those issues.

One possible way to achieve both is via multiple concurrent mnemonic representations along the visual hierarchy that differ systematically from the representations of perceptual inputs. To test this possibility, we examine orientation representations along the visual hierarchy during perception and working memory. Human participants directly viewed, or held in mind, oriented grating patterns, and the similarity between fMRI activation patterns for different orientations was calculated throughout retinotopic cortex. During direct viewing of grating stimuli, similarity was relatively evenly distributed amongst all orientations, while during working memory the similarity was higher around oblique orientations. We modeled these differences in representational geometry based on the known distribution of orientation information in the natural world: The \"veridical\" model uses an efficient coding framework to capture hypothesized representations during visual perception. The \"categorical\" model assumes that different \"psychological distances\" between orientations result in orientation categorization relative to cardinal axes. During direct perception, the veridical model explained the data well. During working memory, the categorical model gradually gained explanatory power over the veridical model for increasingly anterior retinotopic regions. Thus, directly viewed images are represented veridically, but once visual information is no longer tethered to the sensory world there is a gradual progression to more categorical mnemonic formats along the visual hierarchy.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.05.17.541233", "title": "A Novel Pan-RAS Inhibitor with a Unique Mechanism of Action Blocks Tumor Growth in Mouse Models of GI Cancer", "authors": "Foote, J.; Mattox, T.

A major challenge to better understand metabolic regulation is to identify, from the hundreds or thousands of molecules, the key metabolites where the re-orientation of fluxes occurs. Here, a method called ISIS (for In Silico Identification of Switches) is proposed to locate these nodes in a metabolic network, based on the analysis of a set of flux vectors (obtained e.g. by parsimonious flux balance analysis with different inputs). A metabolite is considered as a switch if the fluxes at this point are redirected in a different way when conditions change. The soundness of ISIS is shown with four case studies, using both core and genome-scale metabolic networks of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Through these examples, we show that ISIS can identify hot-spots where fluxes are reoriented. Additionally, switch metabolites are deeply involved in post-translational modification of proteins, showing their importance in cellular regulation. In P. tricornutum, we show that Erythrose 4-phosphate is an important switch metabolite for mixotrophy suggesting the importance of this metabolite in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to orchestrate the flux variations between glycolysis, the Calvin cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway when the trophic mode changes. Finally, a comparison between ISIS and reporter metabolites identified with transcriptomic data confirms the key role of metabolites such as L-glutamate or L-aspartate in the yeast response to nitrogen input variation.

Using somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotency as a model system, we show that activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is tuned by cellular morphomechanic state to direct cell fate. Pluripotent cells and somatic cells reprogramming into pluripotency allocate large amounts of actin into their nucleus, which morphs cells to become taller than 10 m, a minimal height required for the pluripotent identity. Accumulated nuclear actin binds to TFII-I{Delta}, an atypical transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus upon signaling. TFII-I{Delta} also binds to and activates ERK. The binding of TFII-I{Delta} by nuclear actin reduces ERK activity, in coordination with changes in cell/colony height. The tight coupling between cell height and nuclear actin accumulation necessitates the degree of ERK tuning to be mild. Mild ERK inhibition by chemicals recapitulates the tuning by actin-TFII-I{Delta} and turns most cells in reprogramming cultures into pluripotency.

Nonetheless, defining the types and magnitudes of loads that act on tendons during embryonic and early postnatal periods is quite difficult. In this study, we aimed to define the physiologic limb movement and forces experienced during these stages in the murine model.

Creating an in vitro system that models the deformable cellular environment encountered in vivo has been challenging. Here, we engineer microchannels with a liquid-liquid interface that exerts confining pressures (200-3000 Pa) similar to cells in tissues, and, thus, is deformable by cell generated forces. Consequently, the balance between migratory cell-generated and interfacial pressures determines the degree of confinement. Pioneer cells that first contact the interfacial barrier require greater deformation forces to forge a path for migration, and as a result migrate slower than trailing cells. Critically, resistive pressures are tunable by controlling the curvature of the liquid interface, which regulates motility. By granting cells autonomy in determining their confinement, and tuning environmental resistance, interfacial deformations are made to match those of surrounding cells in vivo during interstitial neutrophil migration in a larval zebrafish model. We discover that, in this context, neutrophils employ a bleb-based mechanism of force generation to deform a barrier exerting cell-scale confining pressures.\n\nSignificance StatementImmune cells sense physical forces provided by surrounding cellular tissues to regulate their motility.

We show that these S. pneumoniae mutations do not attenuate microinvasion in either experimental human pneumococcal challenge (EHPC) or in vitro in primary and immortalised epithelial cells.

We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory estimations, logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.\n\nAuthor summaryHumans have the ability to estimate the number of elements in a set without counting. We share this ability with other species, suggesting that it is evolutionarily relevant. However, despite its relevance, this sense is variable and biased. What is the origin of these imprecisions? We take the view that they are the result of an optimal use of limited neural resources. Because of these limitations, stimuli are encoded with noise. The observer then optimally decodes these noisy representations, taking into account its knowledge of the distribution of stimuli. We build on this view and incorporate stimulus presentation time (or contrast) directly into the encoding process using Brownian motion. This model can parsimoniously predict key characteristics of our perception and outperforms quantitatively and qualitatively a popular modeling approach that considers resource limitations at the stage of the response rather than the encoding.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.07.04.547323", "title": "Fractal cycles of sleep: a new aperiodic activity-based definition of sleep cycles", "authors": "Rosenblum, Y.; Jafarzadeh Esfahani, M.; Adelho\u0308fer, N.; Zerr, P.; Furrer, M.; Huber, R.; Roest, F.

While sleep cycles are considered fundamental components of sleep, their functional significance largely remains unclear. One of the reasons for a lack of research progress in this field is the absence of a data-driven definition of sleep cycles. Here, we proposed to base such a definition on fractal (aperiodic) neural activity, a well-established marker of arousal and sleep stages.\n\nWe explored temporal dynamics of fractal activity during nocturnal sleep using electroencephalography. Based on the observed pattern of fractal fluctuations, we introduced a new concept of fractal activity-based cycles of sleep or \"fractal cycles\" for short, defined as a time interval during which fractal activity descends from its local maximum to its local minimum and then leads back to the next local maximum. Next, we assessed correlations between fractal and classical (i.e., non-REM - REM) sleep cycle durations. We also studied cycles with skipped REM sleep, i.e., the cycles where the REM phase is expected to appear except that it does not, being replaced by lightening of sleep.\n\nRegarding the sample, we examined fractal cycles in healthy adults (age range: 18 - 75 years, n = 205) as well as in children and adolescents (range: 8 - 17 years, n = 21), the group characterized by deeper sleep and a higher frequency of cycles with skipped REM sleep. Further, we studied fractal cycles in major depressive disorder (n = 111), the condition characterized by altered REM sleep (in addition to its clinical symptoms).\n\nWe found that fractal and classical cycle durations (89 {+/-} 34 min vs 90 {+/-} 25 min) correlated positively (r = 0.5, p < 0.001). Cycle-to-cycle overnight dynamics showed an inverted U-shape of both fractal and classical cycle durations and a gradual decrease in absolute amplitudes of the fractal descents and ascents from early to late cycles. In adults, the fractal cycle duration and participants age correlated negatively (r = -0.2, p = 0.006). Children and adolescents had shorter fractal cycles compared to young adults (76 {+/-} 34 vs 94 {+/-} 32 min, p < 0.001). The fractal cycle algorithm detected cycles with skipped REM sleep in 91 - 98% of cases. Medicated patients with depression showed longer fractal cycles compared to their own unmedicated state (107 {+/-} 51 min vs 92 {+/-} 38 min, p < 0.001) and age-matched controls (104 {+/-} 49 vs 88 {+/-} 31 min, p < 0.001).\n\nIn conclusion, fractal cycles are an objective, quantifiable, continuous and biologically plausible way to display sleep neural activity and its cycles. They are useful in healthy adult and pediatric populations as well as in patients with major depressive disorder. Fractal cycles should be extensively studied to advance theoretical research on sleep structure.\n\nHighlights- Fractal activity-based cycles of sleep or \"fractal cycles\" for short is a new concept based on cyclic changes in fractal (aperiodic) neural activity during sleep.\n- Durations of fractal and classical cycles correlate, and both show an inverted U-shape when seen from early to late cycles.\n- The fractal cycle algorithm is effective in detecting cycles with skipped REM sleep.\n- Older healthy adults shower shorter fractal - but not classical - cycle durations.\n- Fractal cycle duration is shorter in children and adolescents compared to young adults.\n- In major depressive disorder, antidepressant medication is associated with longer fractal cycles.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.07.25.550338", "title": "Large-scale cortical networks are organized in structured cycles", "authors": "van Es, M.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures neural activity by sensing extracranial magnetic fields. It has recently been transformed from a large, static imaging modality to a wearable method where participants can move freely. This makes wearable MEG systems a prime candidate for naturalistic experiments going forward. However, these experiments will also require novel methods to capture and integrate information about complex behaviour executed during neuroimaging, and it is not yet clear how this could be achieved.\n\nHere we use video recordings of multi-limb dance moves, processed with open-source machine learning methods, to automatically identify analysis time windows of interest in concurrent wearable MEG data.

Identifying the specific residues where proteins bind to DNA is of paramount importance, as it enables the modeling of their interactions and facilitates downstream studies.

Accurate prediction of protein-DNA binding sites has far-reaching implications for understanding molecular mechanisms, disease processes, drug discovery, and synthetic biology applications. It helps bridge the gap between genomics and functional biology, enabling researchers to uncover the intricacies of cellular processes and advance our knowledge of the biological world.

By analogy to pacemakers in the GI and lower urinary tracts, proposed cLV pacemaker cells include interstitial cells of Cajal like cells (ICLC) or the lymphatic muscle (LMCs) cells themselves. Here we combined immunofluorescence and scRNAseq analyses with electrophysiological methods to examine the cellular constituents of the mouse cLV wall and assess whether any cell type exhibited morphological and functional processes characteristic of pacemaker cells: a continuous if not contiguous network integrated into the electrical syncytium; spontaneous Ca2+ transients; and depolarization-induced propagated contractions. We employed inducible Cre (iCre) mouse models routinely used to target these specific cell populations including: c-kitCreERT2 to target ICLC; Pdgfr{beta}CreERT2 to target pericyte-like cells; PdgfrCreERTM to target CD34+ adventitial cells and ICLC; and Myh11CreERT2 to target LMCs directly. These specific inducible Cre lines were crossed to the fluorescent reporter ROSA26mT/mG, the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f, and the light-activated cation channel rhodopsin2 (ChR2). c-KitCreERT2 labeled both a sparse population of LECs and round adventitial cells that responded to the mast cell activator compound 48-80. Pdgfr{beta}CreERT2 drove recombination in both adventitial cells and LMCs, limiting its power to discriminate a pericyte-specific population. PdgfrCreERTM labeled a large population of interconnected, oak leaf-shaped cells primarily along the adventitial surface of the vessel. Of these cells, only LMCs consistently, but heterogeneously, displayed spontaneous Ca2+ events during the diastolic period of the contraction cycle, and whose frequency was modulated in a pressure-dependent manner. Optogenetic depolarization through the expression of ChR2 under control of Myh11CreERT2, but not PdgfrCreERTM or c-KitCreERT2, resulted in propagated contractions upon photo-stimulation. Membrane potential recordings in LMCs demonstrated that the rate of diastolic depolarization significantly correlated with contraction frequency. These findings support the conclusion that LMCs, or a subset of LMCs, are responsible for mouse cLV pacemaking.\n\nImpactThe presence and functionality of proposed pacemaker cells in collecting lymphatic vessels was tested with various mouse Cre models to drive expression of a recombination reporter ROSA26mT/mG, a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f, or the optogenetic tool channel-rhodopsin2.

We identified several shifts towards smaller relative testes mass, presumably reflecting reduced sperm competition. Several sperm traits were associated with relative testes mass, suggesting that mating system evolution selects for convergent suites of traits related to sperm competitive ability. We predicted that sperm competition would also drive more rapid molecular divergence in species with large testes. Contrary to this, we found that many spermatogenesis genes evolved more rapidly in species with smaller relative testes mass due to relaxed purifying selection. While some reproductive genes evolved rapidly under recurrent positive selection, relaxed selection played a greater role in underlying rapid evolution in small testes species.

To address this, we developed an optogenetic approach to delineate the visual center and surround zones of individual neurons in the superficial layer of the superior colliculus (SCs) using only retinal ganglion cell input. Using whole-cell recordings, we demonstrate that surround network activation suppresses center excitability, indicating that SCs circuitry is self-sufficient in driving center-surround dynamics. Through cell-type-specific trans-synaptic tracing and large-scale modeling, we identified an SCs-based circuit with two key motifs driving surround modulation: recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition.

We demonstrate that the SC can independently generate center-surround interactions that could contribute to visual saliency through local circuits without top-down input. This ability represents a computation that has been conserved since the dawn of vertebrate evolution. By mapping these interactions, we reveal that the mouse SC actively induces visual surround suppression.

Classical P4 signaling operates through nuclear receptors that regulate transcription. In addition, P4 signals through membrane P4 receptors (mPRs) in a rapid nongenomic modality. Despite the established physiological importance of P4 nongenomic signaling, the details of its signal transduction cascade remain elusive. Here, using Xenopus oocyte maturation as a well- established physiological readout of nongenomic P4 signaling, we identify the lipid hydrolase ABHD2 (/{beta} hydrolase domain-containing protein 2) as an essential mPR{beta} co-receptor to trigger meiosis. We show using functional assays coupled to unbiased and targeted cell-based lipidomics that ABHD2 possesses a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity that requires mPR{beta}. This PLA2 activity bifurcates P4 signaling by inducing clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPR{beta}, resulting in the production of lipid messengers that are G-protein coupled receptors agonists. Therefore, P4 drives meiosis by inducing an ABHD2 PLA2 activity that requires both mPR{beta} and ABHD2 as obligate co-receptors.\n\nSignificance StatementNongenomic progesterone signaling is important for many physiological functions yet the details of its signaling remain elusive. Here we define the early signaling steps downstream of membrane progesterone receptor {beta} (mPR{beta}) during Xenopus oocyte meiosis.

Here we investigated roles of two histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases Kdm6a/b in controlling neuroprotection and axon regeneration. Deleting either Kdm6a or Kdm6b led to enhanced sensory axon regeneration in the PNS, whereas in the CNS only deleting Kdm6a in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) significantly enhanced optic nerve regeneration. Moreover, both Kdm6a and Kdm6b functioned to regulate RGC survival but with different mechanisms. Mechanistically, Kdm6a regulates RGC regeneration via distinct pathway from that of Pten and co-deleting Kdm6a and Pten resulted in long distance optic nerve regeneration passing the optic chiasm. In addition, RNA-seq profiling revealed that Kdm6a deletion switched the RGC transcriptomics into a developmental-like state and suppressed several known repressors of neural regeneration. Klf4 was identified as a direct downstream target of Kdm6a-H3K27me3 signaling in both sensory neurons and RGCs to regulate axon regeneration. These findings not only revealed different roles of Kdm6a and Kdm6b in regulation of neural regeneration and their underlying mechanisms, but also identified Kdm6a- mediated histone demethylation signaling as a novel epigenetic target for supporting CNS neural regeneration.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.09.22.558524", "title": "TIM-4 Identifies Effector B cells Expressing a ROR\u03b3T-driven Proinflammatory Cytokine Module That Promotes Immune responsiveness", "authors": "Ding, Q.; Wu, Y.; Triglia, E.

It is therefore appealing for conservation and environmental governance to combine that information into single measure of ecosystem or population health. Stability is a desirable feature of ecosystems that supports this aim. It is primarily measured through its resistance, resilience (a.k.a recovery), and variability. The Jacobian matrix is a common characteristic used to identify the resistance and resilience of deterministic mathematical systems and whilst historically it has been challenging to estimate from empirical data, recent work has proposed a suite of metrics capable of reconstructing it for a real-world community using time series data. Here we assess the robustness of three Jacobian metrics and two variability estimating stability metrics (multivariate index of variability and Fisher information) to varying time series lengths and data qualities based on that seen in real-world wildlife time series. We generate data using multispecies Lotka Volterra equations and simulate stressed and unstressed communities of varying species number. These data were then corrupted through the introduction of sampling error (to mimic varying search efforts) and truncating time series (to match the typical time series lengths reported in global biodiversity datasets such as the Living Planet Index and BIOTIME). The robustness of all stability metrics improved with time series length and sampling error in the anticipated manner. However, community size (number of species) dramatically altered metric capability, with larger communities decreasing the reliability of stability metric trends. Overall, stability metrics behave predictably across realistic data corruptions. Generic stability estimation is therefore possible from abundance time series alone, and we suggest that, given the increasing availability of multivariate community data, focussing on Jacobian estimates is a promising avenue of research.

This necessitates either behavioral robustness or goal-relevant adaptation in sensorimotor systems. In the case of hover-feeding hawkmoths of the species Manduca sexta, proboscis mechanosensation and vision are known to combine linearly in tracking of moving flowers. This tracking behavior is affected by light-levels, and visual compensation is necessary for robust flower-tracking. Whether the mechanosensory response also adjusts to light-level, in order to produce linear combination across luminance contexts, is not known. We applied control theoretic analyses to study integration of mechanosensory and visual information in flower tracking hawkmoths in the context of high luminance. This was performed using a two-part robotic flower system. Under the conditions of high luminance, we verified the linear combination of mechanosensory and visual systems, and the complementary modulation of these systems. We show that both systems tune their frequency response with changing environmental light level,while keeping their combined error low at relevant frequencies.

As existing guidelines for surgical intervention based solely on aneurysm diameter face scrutiny, there is a growing need to consider other predictors and parameters, including wall stress, in assessing dissection risk. Through our research, we aim to elucidate the biomechanical underpinnings of aortic dissection and provide valuable insights into its prediction and prevention. We applied finite element analysis (FEA) to assess stress distribution on a rare dataset comprising computed tomography (CT) images obtained from eight patients at three stages of aortic dissection: pre-dissection (preD), post-dissection (postD), and post-repair (postR). Our findings reveal significant increases in both mean and peak aortic wall stresses during the transition from the preD state to the postD state, reflecting the mechanical impact of dissection. Surgical repair effectively restores aortic wall diameter to pre-dissection levels, documenting its effectiveness in mitigating further complications. Furthermore, we identified stress concentration regions within the aortic wall that closely correlated with observed dissection borders, offering insights into high-risk areas. This study demonstrates the importance of considering biomechanical factors when assessing aortic dissection risk.

It is caused by pathogenic variants in ADA2 that lead to impaired ADA2 protein secretion and reduced deaminase activity. However, the mechanisms driving the disease on a cellular level remain elusive. Here, we analyze protein expression of mutant ADA2 in human monocyte-derived macrophages from 10 DADA2 patients. We identify a low-molecular-weight (LMW) form of ADA2 expressed exclusively intracellularly in healthy control macrophages. This LMW-ADA2 is subject to glycan trimming by alpha-mannosidases after transfer to the Golgi and is distinct from secreted high-molecular-weight (HMW) ADA2. DADA2 patients' monocyte-derived macrophages lack LMW-ADA2 and mutant ADA2 does not undergo glycan processing in the Golgi. We confirm the absence of LMW-ADA2 upon overexpression of 11 pathogenic ADA2 variants in HEK293T cells and monocytic U-937 cells. By subcellular fractionation, we show that LMW-ADA2 localizes to the cytosolic and lysosomal compartments.

There is currently a lack of MTIs prediction methods that simultaneously perform feature learning from heterogeneous gene regulatory network (GRN) and genomic sequences. To improve the prediction performance of MTIs, we present a novel transformer-based multiview feature learning method - MiRGraph, which consists of two main modules for learning the sequence-based and GRN-based feature embedding.

The TransCNN and HGT modules can be learned end-to-end to predict experimentally validated MTIs from MiRTarBase.

One explanation for this is the presence of ecological limits to diversity and hence to diversification. Previous research has examined whether and how species richness (SR) impacts diversification rates, but rarely considered the evolutionary relatedness (ER) between species, even though phylogenetic distance can play a role in the degree of competition between species, which likely sets these ecological limits. To understand the influence of ecological limits represented by ER on species diversification, and to investigate the interplay between SR and ER effects on diversification, we present a new phylogenetic birth-death model in which the speciation rate depends on the ER between species. We use different metrics of ER that operate at different scales, from lineage-specific to clade-wide. We find that the different scales of ER effect yield distinct patterns in speciation rates and various tree statistics. When ER operates across the whole tree, we observe smaller and more balanced phylogenetic trees, with internal nodes concentrated more closely to the root and speciation rates distributed more evenly across the tips than in scenarios with lineage-specific ER effects. Importantly, we find that the presence of negative SR dependence can reduce the influence of ER on some of the tree statistics. This suggests that these tree statistics should not be used to detect an effect of evolutionary relatedness on clade diversification.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.11.14.567080", "title": "Optimizing Niosome Formulations for Enhanced Cellular Applications: A Comparative Case Study with L-\u03b1-lecithin Liposomes", "authors": "Cakir, N.; Ozturk, N.; Kara, A.; Zarrabi, A.; Mustafaoglu, N.", "author_corresponding": "Nur Mustafaoglu", "author_corresponding_institution": "Sabanci University", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "bioengineering", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2023.11.14.567080.source.xml", "abstract": "This study delves into the optimization of niosome production for biological applications, focusing on their emerging role as amphiphilic nanoparticles derived from nonionic surfactants, poised at the forefront of biomedical research.

Critical thresholds for size, polydispersity, and zeta potential were established to identify parameters crucial for optimal niosomal formulations through a comprehensive investigation of concentrations, sonication times, ingredient ratios, and surfactant types.

An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types.

In redefining the synergy concept to describe a hierarchical decomposition of task-objectives comprised of distinct muscle interactions types, i.e. functionally similar, complementary and independent, in our newly established framework here we aimed to probe this recently proposed functional neural architecture across scales. Through a novel application of the Partial Information Decomposition to large-scale muscle activations, we unveiled complex networks of inter- and intra-muscular interactions with distinct functional roles as well as independent muscle contributions to task performance. We showcased the effectiveness of this approach in a toy simulation and by extracting hierarchical and functionally diverse motor components from benchmark datasets that were a) generalisable across participants and tasks and b) correlated with balance performance across trials and of differences in motor variability between young and older adults.

These forces predominantly arise from contractility of the actomyosin cortex, allowing for cortical tension, protrusion formation, and cell division. Image-based force inference can derive such forces from microscopy images, without complicated and time-consuming experimental set-ups. However, current methods do not account for common effects, such as physical confinement and local force generation. Here we propose a force-inference method based on a biophysical model of cell shape, and assess relative cellular surface tension, adhesive tension between cells, as well as cytokinesis and protrusion formation.

Predictions for cell surface tension at the 7-cell stage were validated by measurements using cortical laser ablation. Our non-invasive method facilitates the accurate tracking of force generation, and offers many new perspectives for studying morphogenesis.\n\nAuthor summaryAn important challenge in understanding morphogenesis is to determine where forces are generated. Force generation, such as differential cortical tension, plays a key role in cellular self-organization. However, measuring these forces experimentally is a big challenge that typically requires complicated experiments and direct access to the cells being investigated. A non-invasive method, such as force inference based on cell shapes, would have important advantages. Unfortunately, current methods can only be applied in certain cases. Here, we describe a more flexible 3D force inference method, FIDES, that can account for physical confinement, cell divisions and protrusions. We applied the method to infer forces throughout early C. elegans embryogenesis. By using cortical laser ablations, we confirmed that FIDES correctly inferred cell surface tensions in a dynamic stage of the nematodes embryogenesis. Our approach offers a route to routinely infer force generation in complex movements during morphogenesis, with microscopy images of cell shapes as the sole experimental input.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.12.04.569887", "title": "New neural-inspired controller generalises modularity over lower limb tasks through internal models", "authors": "Munoz, D.; Holland, D.; Severini, G.", "author_corresponding": "David Munoz", "author_corresponding_institution": "University College Dublin", "date": "2024-10-08", "version": "4", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/08/2023.12.04.569887.source.xml", "abstract": "Predictive neuromuscular models based on neural controllers are a powerful tool for testing assumptions on the underlying architecture of sensorimotor control and its associated neural activity. However, most current controllers suffer from lack of physiological plausibility and are generally task specific. We propose a new neural controller, called Internal Model-based Modular Controller (IMMC), where a hierarchical architecture organises generalizable modules in activation networks dedicated to different motion tasks. The architecture comprises a simple model of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which sends controlling signals that manage the activity of internal models (IMs). The IMs organise synergies, coordinated and stereotyped activity of multiple muscles, in task-specific networks. The resultant organisations allow the generalisation of this architecture to different lower limb motions. The IMMC was tested in Stand-To-Walk simulations (STW), where the MLR switches between two IMs that recombine five synergies to replicate the standing and walking tasks. The simulation kinematics, muscle activation patterns and ground reaction forces were generally consistent with experimental data. In addition, the controller can transition to slower and faster speeds by tuning a single controlling signal.

We developed a one-pot approach to map eQTLs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and applied it to over 100,000 single cells from three crosses. We used scRNA-seq data to genotype each cell, measure gene expression, and classify the cells by cell-cycle stage. We mapped thousands of local and distant eQTLs and identified interactions between eQTL effects and cell-cycle stages. We took advantage of single-cell expression information to identify hundreds of genes with allele-specific effects on expression noise. We used cell-cycle stage classification to map 20 loci that influence cell-cycle progression. One of these loci influenced the expression of genes involved in the mating response. We showed that the effects of this locus arise from a common variant (W82R) in the gene GPA1, which encodes a signaling protein that negatively regulates the mating pathway. The 82R allele increases mating efficiency at the cost of slower cell-cycle progression and is associated with a higher rate of outcrossing in nature.

Here, we produced microfluidic channels that contained sediment-mimicking obstacles to study swimming of magnetotactic bacteria in a near-realistic environment. Magnetotactic bacteria are microor-ganisms that form chains of nanomagnets and that orient in Earths magnetic field. The obstacles were produced based on micro-computer tomography reconstructions of bacteria-rich sediment samples. We characterized the swimming of the cells through these channels and found that swimming throughput was highest for physiological magnetic fields. This observation was confirmed by extensive computer simulations using an active Brownian particle model, which were parameterized based on experimental trajectories, in particular with the trajectories near the sediment-mimicking obstacles, from which the interactions of the swimming bacteria with the obstacles were determined. The simulations were used to quantify the swimming throughput in detail. They showed the behavior seen in experiments, but also exhibited considerable variability between different channel geometries. The simulations indicate that swimming at strong fields is impeded by the trapping of bacteria in \"corners\" that require transient swimming against the magnetic field for escape. At weak fields, the direction of swimming is almost random, making the process inefficient as well. We confirmed the trapping effect in our experiments and showed that lowering the field strength allows the bacteria to escape. We hypothesize that over the course of evolution, magnetotactic bacteria have thus evolved to produce magnetic properties that are adapted to the geomagnetic field in order to balance movement and orientation in such crowded environments.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2023.12.08.570752", "title": "Cortical tracking of postural sways during standing balance.", "authors": "Legrand, T.; Mongold, S.

Center-of-pressure (CoP) fluctuations and electroencephalographic cortical activity were recorded as young healthy participants performed balance tasks during which sensory information was manipulated, by either removal or alteration. We found that postural sways are represented in ongoing cortical activity during challenging balance conditions, in the form of CKC at 1-6 Hz. Time delays between cortical activity and CoP features indicated that both afferent and efferent pathways contribute to CKC, wherein the brain would monitor the CoP velocity and control its position. Importantly, CKC was behaviorally relevant, as it predicted the increase in instability brought by alteration of sensory information.

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is required to treat such a condition but it is associated with a small increase in birth defects in comparison to pregnancies not involving assisted conception. Consequently, new targeted treatments are needed to restore fertility. Here, a combination of in vivo injection and electroporation of capped and poly-A-tailed naked mRNA is tested as a strategy to treat ARMC2-related infertility in mouse. mRNAs coding for several reporter genes are tested and the efficiency and the kinetic of expression are assessed using in vivo and in vitro 2D and 3D imaging experiments.

To resolve this question, we performed scATAC-seq in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 16 children with asthma with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and treated with dexamethasone (DEX), an antiinflammatory glucocorticoid. We analyzed changes in chromatin accessibility, measured transcription factor motif activity, and identified treatment and cell-type specific transcription factors that drive changes in both gene expression mean and variability. We observed strong positive linear dependence between motif response and their target gene expression changes, but negative in variability changes. This result suggests that an increase of transcription factor binding tightens the variability of gene expression around the mean. We then annotated genetic variants in chromatin accessibility peaks and response motifs followed by computational fine-mapping of eQTL signals from a pediatric asthma cohort. We found that eQTLs were 5-fold enriched in peaks with response motifs and refined the credible set for 410 asthma risk genes, with 191 having the causal variant in response motifs.

Our study introduces a novel approach to this field, aiming to expand the search space for new therapeutic agents. We introduce PDGrapher, a causally-inspired graph neural network (GNN) designed to predict combinatorial perturbagens - sets of therapeutic targets - capable of reversing disease effects. Unlike methods that learn responses to perturbations, PDGrapher solves the inverse problem, which is to infer the perturbagens necessary to achieve a specific response - i.e., directly predicting perturbagens by learning which perturbations elicit a desired response. By encoding gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interactions, PDGrapher can predict unseen chemical or genetic perturbagens, aiding in the discovery of novel drugs or therapeutic targets. Experiments across nine cell lines with chemical perturbations show that PDGrapher successfully predicted effective perturbagens in up to 13.33% additional test samples and ranked therapeutic targets up to 35% higher than the competing methods, and the method shows competitive performance across ten genetic perturbation datasets. A key innovation of PDGrapher is its direct prediction capability, which contrasts with the indirect, computationally intensive models traditionally used in phenotype-driven drug discovery that only predict changes in phenotypes due to perturbations. The direct approach enables PDGrapher to train up to 25 times faster than methods like scGEN and CellOT, representing a considerable leap in efficiency. Our results suggest that PDGrapher can advance phenotype-driven drug discovery, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to identifying therapeutically useful perturbations.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.01.04.574106", "title": "Quantifying the Prevalence of Non-B DNA Motifs as a Marker of Non-B Burden in Cancer using NBBC", "authors": "Xu, Q.; Kowalski, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jeanne Kowalski", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Texas at Austin", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "cancer biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.01.04.574106.source.xml", "abstract": "Alternative DNA structures, such as Z-DNA, G-quadruplexes, and mirror repeats, have shown potential involvement in cancer etiology.

TRIO uses its two guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains to activate GTPases (GEF1: Rac1 and RhoG; GEF2: RhoA) that control neuronal development and connectivity. It remains unclear how discrete TRIO variants differentially impact these neurodevelopmental events. Here, we investigate how heterozygosity for NDD-associated Trio variants: +/K1431M (ASD), +/K1918X (SCZ), and +/M2145T (bipolar disorder, BPD) - impact mouse behavior, brain development, and synapse structure and function. Heterozygosity for different Trio variants impacts motor, social, and cognitive behaviors in distinct ways that align with clinical phenotypes in humans. Trio variants differentially impact head and brain size with corresponding changes in dendritic arbors of motor cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons (M1 L5 PNs). Although neuronal structure was only modestly altered in the Trio variant heterozygotes, we observe significant changes in synaptic function and plasticity. We also identified distinct changes in glutamate synaptic release in +/K1431M and +/M2145T cortico-cortical synapses. The TRIO K1431M GEF1 domain has impaired ability to promote GTP exchange on Rac1, but +/K1431M mice exhibit increased Rac1 activity, associated with increased levels of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1. Acute Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 rescued glutamate release deficits in +/K1431M variant cortex.

However, the variability between individual iPSC lines and the lack of efficient technology to comprehensively characterize iPSC-derived cell types hinder its adoption in routine preclinical screening settings. To facilitate the validation of iPSC-derived cell culture composition, we have implemented an imaging assay based on cell painting and convolutional neural networks to recognize cell types in dense and mixed cultures with high fidelity. We have benchmarked our approach using pure and mixed cultures of neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines and attained a classification accuracy above 96%. Through iterative data erosion we found that inputs containing the nuclear region of interest and its close environment, allow achieving equally high classification accuracy as inputs containing the whole cell for semi-confluent cultures and preserved prediction accuracy even in very dense cultures. We then applied this regionally restricted cell profiling approach to evaluate the differentiation status of iPSC-derived neural cultures, by determining the ratio of postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors. We found that the cell-based prediction significantly outperformed an approach in which the time in culture was used as classification criterion (96% vs. 86%, resp.). In mixed iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, microglia could be unequivocally discriminated from neurons, regardless of their reactivity state. A tiered strategy, allowed for discriminating microglial cell states as well, albeit with lower accuracy.

Grounded in psychological and neuroscientific theories that integrate emotion with cognition, our research explores the interplay between prior knowledge, preservice teachers' anticipatory situational emotions, and subsequent learning in an experimental science education context. Analysing data from 269 preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds (STEM and non-STEM) at the upper-secondary level, we found that negative activating emotions are often rooted in non-STEM backgrounds and exacerbated by limited prior science knowledge. These negative emotions impact achievement and learning primarily through the mediating role of boredom. Furthermore, our results indicate that the detrimental impact of boredom on achievement is significantly influenced by prior knowledge, with a more pronounced effect on students with lower levels.

By integrating a deep neural network with the drift-diffusion model on reaction time data, we identified parallel processing of perceptual and conceptual features during perception, rather than sequential processing. The slower reaction times observed in conceptual tasks compared to perceptual tasks were primarily driven by the larger decision boundary and longer non-decision time associated with conceptual features, which could not be compensated by their faster evidence accumulation rates. Using single-trial multivariate decoding of MEG (magnetoencephalography) data to examine the timing of neural representations of different features, we found that selective attention reversed the onset times of perceptual and conceptual features in the occipital and parietal lobes during perception. This led to earlier detection of conceptual features compared to perceptual features in the animacy and size tasks. During retrieval, the colour task exhibited earlier peak times for perceptual features compared to conceptual features in the frontal lobe, indicating that perceptual features were reconstructed with the highest fidelity before conceptual features.

Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C, disrupt this balance by weakening the nuclear lamina. This results in nuclear damage in contractile tissues and ultimately muscle disease. Intriguingly, disrupting the LINC complex that connects the cytoskeleton to the nucleus has emerged as a promising strategy to ameliorate LMNA-associated cardiomyopathy. Yet how LINC complex disruption protects the cardiomyocyte nucleus remains unclear. To address this, we developed an assay to quantify the coupling of cardiomyocyte contraction to nuclear deformation and interrogated its dependence on the nuclear lamina and LINC complex. We found that, surprisingly, the LINC complex was mostly dispensable for transferring contractile strain to the nucleus, and that increased nuclear strain in lamin A/C-deficient cardiomyocytes was not rescued by LINC complex disruption. Instead, LINC complex disruption eliminated the cage of microtubules encircling the nucleus. Disrupting microtubules was sufficient to prevent nuclear damage and rescue cardiac function induced by lamin A/C deficiency. We computationally simulated the stress fields surrounding cardiomyocyte nuclei and show how microtubule forces generate local vulnerabilities that damage lamin A/C-deficient nuclei. Our work pinpoints localized, microtubule-dependent force transmission through the LINC complex as a pathological driver and therapeutic target for LMNA-cardiomyopathy.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/579774v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1387b00org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1137819org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131b1dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193f597_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.02.10.579779", "title": "Enhancing Bone Regeneration and Osseointegration using rhPTH(1-34) and Dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) in an Osteoporotic Beagle Model", "authors": "Shin, J.-O.; Lee, J.-b.; Lee, S.; Kim, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jinwoo Kim", "author_corresponding_institution": "Ewha Womans University", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "5", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "pathology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.02.10.579779.source.xml", "abstract": "IntroductionDespite continuous parathyroid hormone (PTH) exposure potentially accelerating bone resorption, intermittent PTH administration has shown anabolic effects on bone microarchitecture.

However, no extensive study has been conducted to date to assess their performance - i.e. the capacity of the indicators to reflect variations in biodiversity - against multitaxonomic data. We hypothesized that no single biodiversity indicator from Forest Europe can represent overall forest biodiversity, but that several indicators would reflect habitat quality for at least some taxa in a comprehensive way. We tested the set of Forest Europes indicators against the species richness of six taxonomic and functional groups across several hundreds of sampling units over Europe.

It has also been reported in parvalbumin-positive hippocampal basket cells, in dendrites innervated by feedback excitatory synapses. Whether other interneurons, which support feed-forward or feedback inhibition of principal neuron dendrites, also exhibit local non-linear integration of synaptic excitation is not known. Here we use patch-clamp electrophysiology, and 2-photon calcium imaging and glutamate uncaging, to show that supralinear dendritic integration of near-synchronous spatially clustered glutamate-receptor mediated depolarization occurs in NDNF-positive neurogliaform cells and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons in the mouse hippocampus. Supralinear summation was detected via recordings of somatic depolarizations elicited by uncaging of glutamate on dendritic fragments, and, in neurogliaform cells, by concurrent imaging of dendritic calcium transients. Supralinearity was abolished by blocking NMDA receptors (NMDARs) but resisted blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Blocking L-type calcium channels abolished supralinear calcium signalling but only had a minor effect on voltage supralinearity.

Although there is growing evidence that the auditory system relies on statistical representations for perceiving 1-5 and coding4,6-9 natural sounds, its less clear how statistical cues and neural representations contribute to segregating speech in natural auditory scenes. We demonstrate that human listeners rely on mid-level statistics to segregate and recognize speech in environmental noise. Using natural backgrounds and variants with perturbed spectro-temporal statistics, we show that speech recognition accuracy at a fixed noise level varies extensively across natural backgrounds (0% to 100%). Furthermore, for each background the unique interference created by summary statistics can mask or unmask speech, thus hindering or improving speech recognition. To identify the neural coding strategy and statistical cues that influence accuracy, we developed generalized perceptual regression, a framework that links summary statistics from a neural model to word recognition accuracy. Whereas a peripheral cochlear model accounts for only 60% of perceptual variance, summary statistics from a mid-level auditory midbrain model accurately predicts single trial sensory judgments, accounting for more than 90% of the perceptual variance. Furthermore, perceptual weights from the regression framework identify which statistics and tuned neural filters are influential and how they impact recognition. Thus, perception of speech in natural backgrounds relies on a mid-level auditory representation involving interference of multiple summary statistics that impact recognition beneficially or detrimentally across natural background sounds.\n\nSignificance StatementRecognizing speech in natural auditory scenes with competing talkers and environmental noise is a critical cognitive skill. Although normal listeners effortlessly perform this task, for instance in a crowded restaurant, it challenges individuals with hearing loss and our most sophisticated machine systems.

Using a model of the auditory system, we then demonstrate that a brain inspired statistical representation of natural sounds accurately predicts human perceptual trends across wide range of natural backgrounds and noise levels and reveals key statistical features and neural computations underlying human abilities for this task.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.02.13.580067", "title": "HairSplitter: haplotype assembly from long, noisy reads", "authors": "Faure, R.; Lavenier, D.; Flot, J.-F.", "author_corresponding": "Roland Faure", "author_corresponding_institution": "Univ.

Despite the widely recognized burden of zoonotic spillover, our ability to identify which animal populations serve as primary reservoirs for these pathogens remains incomplete. This challenge is compounded when prevalence reaches detectable levels only at specific times of year. In these cases, statistical models designed to predict the timing of peak prevalence could guide field sampling for active infections. Thus, we develop a general model that leverages routinely collected serosurveillance data to optimize sampling for elusive pathogens by predicting time windows of peak prevalence. Using simulated data sets, we show that our methodology reliably identifies times when pathogen prevalence is expected to peak. Then, we demonstrate an implementation of our method using publicly available data from two putative Ebolavirus reservoirs, straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and hammer-headed bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus). We envision our method being used to guide the planning of field sampling to maximize the probability of detecting active infections, and in cases when longitudinal data is available, our method can also yield predictions for the times of year that are most likely to produce future spillover events. The generality and simplicity of our methodology make it broadly applicable to a wide range of putative reservoir species where seasonal patterns of birth lead to predictable, but potentially short-lived, pulses of pathogen prevalence.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMany deadly pathogens, such as Ebola, Rabies, Lassa, and Nipah viruses, originate in wildlife and jump to human populations. When this occurs, human health is at risk. At the extreme, this can lead to pandemics such as the West African Ebola epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the widely recognized risk wildlife pathogens pose to humans, identifying host species that serve as primary reservoirs for many pathogens remains challenging. A key obstacle to confirming reservoir hosts is sampling animals with active infections. Often, disease prevalence fluctuates seasonally in wildlife populations and only reaches detectable levels at certain times of year. In these cases, statistical models designed to predict the timing of peak prevalence could guide efficient field sampling for active infections. Therefore, we have developed a general model that uses serological data to predict times of year when pathogen prevalence is likely to peak. We demonstrate with simulated data that our method produces reliable predictions, and then demonstrate an application of our method on two hypothesized reservoirs for Ebola virus, straw-colored fruit bats and hammer-headed bats. Our method can be broadly applied to a range of potential reservoir species where seasonal patterns of birth can lead to predictable pulses of peak pathogen prevalence. Overall, our method can guide future sampling of reservoir populations and can also be used to make predictions for times of year for which future outbreaks in human populations are most likely to occur.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.02.19.580982", "title": "Pathologic \u03b1-Synuclein-NOD2 Interaction and RIPK2 Activation Drives Microglia-Induced Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease", "authors": "Seo, B.

As a proxy internal model, we developed a neural network that uses current sensory context to predict future spectrotemporal features of a vocal communication signal, birdsong. We then represent birdsong as either weighted sets of latent predictive features evolving in time, or as time-varying prediction-errors that reflect the difference between ongoing network-predicted and actual song. Using these spectrotemporal, predictive, and prediction-error song representations, we fit linear/non-linear receptive fields to single neuron responses recorded from caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), caudal mesopallium (CMM) and Field L, analogs of mammalian auditory cortices, in anesthetized European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, listening to conspecific songs. In all three regions, the predictive features of song yield the single best model of song-evoked spiking responses, but unique information about all three representations (signal, prediction, and error) is carried in the spiking responses to song. The relative weighting of this information varies across regions, but in contrast to many computational predictive coding models neither predictive nor error responses are segregated in separate neurons.

Mutations can modify the activity of regulatory DNA, and also create new regulatory DNA, a process called regulatory emergence. Non-regulatory and regulatory DNA contain motifs to which transcription factors may bind. In prokaryotes, gene expression requires a stretch of DNA called a promoter, which contains two motifs called -10 and -35 boxes. However, these motifs may occur in both promoters and non-promoter DNA in multiple copies. They have been implicated in some studies to improve promoter activity, and in others to repress it. Here, we ask whether the presence of such motifs in different genetic sequences influences promoter evolution and emergence. To understand whether and how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution, we start from 50 \"promoter islands\", DNA sequences enriched with -10 and -35 boxes. We mutagenize these starting \"parent\" sequences, and measure gene expression driven by 240000 of the resulting mutants. We find that the probability that mutations create an active promoter varies more than 200-fold, and is not correlated with the number of promoter motifs. For parent sequences without promoter activity, mutations created over 1500 new -10 and -35 boxes at unique positions in the library, but only [~]0.3% of these resulted in de-novo promoter activity. Only [~]13% of all -10 and -35 boxes contribute to de-novo promoter activity. For parent sequences with promoter activity, mutations create new -10 and -35 boxes in 11 specific positions that partially overlap with preexisting ones to modulate expression.

This is because asexual reproduction is a far more efficient way to transmit copies of ones own genome to the next generation, and, all-else-being-equal, should predominate over sex. Asexual reproduction is not without its disadvantages though, the lack of genetic recombination can render parthenogenetic lineages vulnerable to extinction under environmental change, or compromise fitness due to the buildup of deleterious recessive mutations. Facultative sex, where individuals retain the ability to reproduce sexually and asexually, has been touted as \"the best of both worlds\", providing the long-term genetic benefits of sex without the short-term costs. In this study I tested whether sex is facultative in the aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum, and if so whether facultative sex is \"the best of both worlds\". I found that females from asexual populations mate with males produced by females from an obligately sexual population, and produced offspring with paternal genetic contributions, confirming facultative sex in this species. I then assayed the fitness of these facultatively sexual wasps and found, contrary to predictions that they actually had significantly lower fitness than asexual or obligately sexual females, as their daughters were up to 40% more likely to fail to reproduce entirely. In contrast, obligately sexual females were not at a disadvantage compared to asexual females in this species; they had increased fecundity compared to asexual females which compensated for the costs of sex. In L. fabarum it seems that all is not equal; the fecundity advantage that obligate sex provides, along with the costs of occasional facultative sex by asexuals may balance the scales and allow stable coexistence of the different reproductive modes in nature.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.02.28.582617", "title": "Dynamic reinforcement learning reveals time-dependent shifts in strategy during reward learning.", "authors": "Venditto, S.

To determine which vascular cell types express ADAMTS7, we interrogated single-cell RNA sequencing of human carotid atherosclerosis and found ADAMTS7 expression in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and fibroblasts. We subsequently created SMC- and EC-specific Adamts7 conditional knockout and transgenic mice. Conditional knockout of Adamts7 in either cell type is insufficient to reduce atherosclerosis, whereas transgenic induction in either cell type increases atherosclerosis. In SMC transgenic mice, this increase coincides with an expansion of lipid-laden SMC foam cells and decreased fibrous cap formation. RNA-sequencing in SMCs revealed an upregulation of lipid uptake genes typically assigned to macrophages. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that ADAMTS7 increases SMC oxLDL uptake through increased CD36 levels. Furthermore, Cd36 expression is increased due to increased levels of PU.1, a transcription factor typically associated with myeloid fate determination. In summary, Adamts7 expression in either SMCs or ECs promotes SMC foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.

Analyses of gene networks and upstream regulators implicated processes involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination in WIA, neuroinflammation in Demand, and metabolism in Reinstatement. Motif analysis of ATAC-seq showed changes in chromatin accessibility to a small set of transcription factor (TF) binding sites as a function either of opioid exposure (i.e., morphine versus saline) generally or of individual vulnerability specifically. Some of these were shared across the 3 paradigms and others were unique to each.

This task is made more difficult because a single mutation can affect both immune escape and replication. Here, we develop an evolutionary model that disentangles the effects of escaping CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity, which we model as a binary trait, from other contributions to fitness. After validation in simulations, we applied this model to study within-host HIV-1 evolution in a clinical data set. We observed strong selection for immune escape, sometimes greatly exceeding past estimates, especially early in infection.

None of the hypotheses proposed in the literature is firmly established, mainly due to the many confounding factors related to the diverse habitats of species with streamlined genomes. Computational models may help overcome these difficulties and rigorously test hypotheses. In this work, we used Aevol, a platform designed to study the evolution of genome architecture, to test two main hypotheses: that an increase in population size (N) or mutation rate ({micro}) could cause genome reduction. In our experiments, both conditions lead to streamlining, but with very different resulting genome structures. Under increased population sizes, genomes loose a significant fraction of non-coding sequences, but maintain their coding size, resulting in densely packed genomes (akin to streamlined marine bacteria genomes). By contrast, under increased mutation rate, genomes loose both coding and non-coding sequences (akin to endosymbiotic bacteria genomes). Hence, both factors lead to an overall reduction in genome size, but the coding density of the genome appears to be determined by N x {micro}. Thus, a broad range of genome size and density can be achieved by different combinations of N and {micro}. Our results suggest that genome size and coding density are determined by the interplay between selection for phenotypic adaptation and selection for robustness.\n\nSignificance statementMany bacterial species show reduced genomes. However, the diversity of these species and of their life traits makes it difficult to identify the mechanisms that led to this reduction. Indeed, no unifying hypothesis accounts for the whole diversity of genome size reduction. Here, we used simulations to systematically explore the effect of population size and mutation rate on genome size. We show that the interaction between these two factors tightly determine the size, but also the density of genomes, making it possible to account for the whole diversity of reduced genomes by acting on these two parameters only.

To confront this problem of overfitting, sparse models can focus on key predictors by correctly placing low weight on unimportant variables. We competed nine methods to quantify their performance in variable selection and prediction using simulated data with different sample sizes, numbers of predictors, and strengths of effects. Overfitting was typical for many methods and simulation scenarios. Despite this, in-sample and out-of-sample prediction converged on the true predictive target for simulations with more observations, larger causal effects, and fewer predictors.

Considerable recent efforts are therefore being channeled towards understanding the nature of pathogen emergence, their spread and evolution. Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. perforans (Xep), one of the causal agents of bacterial spot of tomato, rapidly emerged and displaced other bacterial spot xanthomonads in tomato production regions around the world. In less than three decades, it has become a dominant xanthomonad pathogen in tomato production systems across the world and presents a model for understanding diversification of recently emerged bacterial plant pathogens. Although Xep has been continuously monitored in Florida since its discovery, the global population structure and evolution at the genome-scale is yet to be fully explored. The objectives of this work were to determine genetic diversity globally to ascertain if different tomato production regions contain genetically distinct Xep populations, to examine genetic relatedness of strains collected in tomato seed production areas in East Asia and other production regions, and to evaluate variation in type III effectors, which are critical pathogenicity and virulence factors, in relationship to population structure. We used genome data from 270 strains from 13 countries for phylogenetic analysis and characterization of Xop effector gene diversity among strains. Our results showed notable genetic diversity in the pathogen. We found genetically similar strains in distant tomato production regions, including seed production regions, and diversification over the past 100 years, which is consistent with intercontinental dissemination of the pathogen in hybrid tomato production chains. Evolution of the Xep pangenome, including the acquisition and loss of type III secreted effectors, is apparent within and among phylogenetic lineages. The apparent long-distance movement of the pathogen, together with variants that may not yet be widely distributed, poses risks of emergence of new variants in tomato production.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.03.20.585960", "title": "Rapid evolution of recombination landscapes during the divergence of cichlid ecotypes in Lake Masoko", "authors": "Talbi, M.; Turner, G.

Many unknowns remain regarding how and why recombination landscapes evolve in nature. Here, we reconstruct recombination maps based on linkage disequilibrium and use subsampling and simulations to derive a new measure of recombination landscape evolution: the Population Recombination Divergence Index (PRDI). Using PRDI, we show that fine-scale recombination landscapes differ substantially between two cichlid fish ecotypes of Astatotilapia calliptera that diverged only [~]2,500 generations ago. Perhaps surprisingly, recombination landscape differences are not driven by divergence in terms of allele frequency (FST) and nucleotide diversity ({Delta}({pi})): although there is some association, we observe positive PRDI in regions where FST and{Delta} ({pi}) are zero. We found a stronger association between evolution of recombination and 47 large haplotype blocks that are polymorphic in Lake Masoko, cover 21% of the genome, and appear to include multiple inversions. Among haplotype blocks, there is a strong and clear association between the degree of recombination divergence and differences between ecotypes in heterozygosity, consistent with recombination suppression in heterozygotes.

However, several follow-up studies have questioned the validity of this astrocyte to DAN conversion model. In this study, we devised an adenine base editing strategy to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons in a chemically-induced PD mouse model. While PTBP1 downregulation in astrocytes had no effect, we observed that PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum resulted in the expression of the DAN marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in non-dividing neurons, which was associated with an increase in striatal dopamine concentrations and a rescue of forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Phenotypic analysis using multiplexed iterative immunofluorescence imaging further revealed that most of the TH-positive cells in the striatum co-expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT and the pan-neuronal marker NEUN, with the majority of these triple-positive cells being classified as mature GABAergic neurons. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of the observed markers and understand how the formation of these cells contributes to the rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors.

We achieve high specificity of axonal fractions, ensuring sample purity without contamination. Comparative analysis revealed a unique and specific transcriptional landscape in axonal compartments, characterized by diverse transcript types, including protein-coding mRNAs, RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs), mitochondrial-encoded RNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

Here, we detect a set of TFs specific to the axon and indicative of their active participation in transcriptional regulation. To investigate transcripts and pathways essential for central motor neuron (MN) degeneration and maintenance we analyzed KIF1C-knockout (KO) CNs, modeling hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a disorder associated with prominent length-dependent degeneration of central MN axons. We found that several key factors crucial for survival and health were absent in KIF1C-KO axons, highlighting a possible role of these also in other neurodegenerative diseases. Taken together, this study underscores the utility of microfluidic devices in studying compartment-specific transcriptomics in human neuronal models and reveals complex molecular dynamics of axonal biology.

The C-terminal half (CTH, residues 530-1061) is dispensable for viability. We have previously described a phenomenon of recessive resurrection in RNase E that requires the CTH, wherein the wild-type homo-tetramer displays identical activity in vivo as a hetero-tetramer comprised of three catalytically dead subunits (with D303A/D346A substitutions) and one wild-type subunit. Here we show that recessive resurrection is exhibited even in dimeric RNase E with the CTH, and that it is dependent on presence of the membrane-targeting-sequence motif (residues 565-582). A single F575E substitution also abolished recessive resurrection, whereas other CTH motifs (such as those for binding of RNA or of partner proteins) were dispensable. The phenomenon was independent of RNA 5'-monophosphate sensing by the enzyme. We propose that membrane-anchoring of RNase E renders it uniquely processive for endoribonucleolytic action, and that recessive resurrection and dominant negativity are alternative and mutually exclusive manifestations of, respectively, processive and distributive catalytic mechanisms in a homo-oligomeric enzyme.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.04.05.588322", "title": "Drosophila Hamlet mediates epithelial tissue assembly of the reproductive system", "authors": "Wang, H.; Bertonnier-Brouty, L.; Artner, I.; Wen, J.; Dai, Q.", "author_corresponding": "Qi Dai", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Molecular Bioscience, the Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Sweden", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "developmental biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.04.05.588322.source.xml", "abstract": "Epithelial tissue fusion requires coordinated molecular events at the ends of two epithelial structures.

The robustness and universality of this correlation have led to its classification as a growth law. This law has fueled theories about how evolution selects for microbial organisms that maximize their growth rate based on nutrient availability, and it has informed models about how individual cells regulate their growth rates and ribosomal content. However, due to methodological limitations, this growth law has rarely been studied at the level of individual cells. While populations of fast-growing cells tend to have more ribosomes than populations of slow-growing cells, it is unclear whether individual cells tightly regulate their ribosome content to match their environment. Here, we employ recent groundbreaking single-cell RNA sequencing techniques to study this growth law at the single-cell level in two different microbes, S. cerevisiae (a single-celled yeast and eukaryote) and B. subtilis (a bacterium and prokaryote). In both species, we observe significant variation in the ribosomal content of single cells that is not predictive of growth rate. Fast-growing populations include cells exhibiting transcriptional signatures of slow growth and stress, as do cells with the highest ribosome content we survey. Broadening our focus to non-ribosomal transcripts reveals subpopulations of cells in unique transcriptional states suggestive that they have evolved to do things other than maximize their rate of growth. Overall, these results indicate that single-cell ribosome levels are not finely tuned to match population growth rates or nutrient availability and cannot be predicted by a Gaussian process model that assumes measurements are sampled from a normal distribution centered on the population average. This work encourages the expansion of growth law and other models that predict how growth rates are regulated or how they evolve to consider single-cell heterogeneity.

However, the precise allosteric mechanism governing channel activation upon ligand binding, particularly the energetic changes within domains, remains poorly understood. The prokaryotic CNBD channel SthK offers a valuable model for investigating this allosteric mechanism. In this study, we investigated the conformational dynamics and energetics of the SthK C-terminal region using a combination of steady-state and time-resolved transition metal ion Forster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) experiments. We engineered donor-acceptor pairs at specific sites within a SthK C-terminal fragment by incorporating a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid donor and metal ion acceptors. Measuring tmFRET with fluorescence lifetimes, we determined intramolecular distance distributions in the absence and presence of cAMP or cGMP. The probability distributions between conformational states without and with ligand were used to calculate the changes in free energy ({Delta}G) and differences in free energy change ({Delta}{Delta}G) in the context of a simple four-state model. Our findings reveal that cAMP binding produces large structural changes, with a very favorable {Delta}{Delta}G. In contrast to cAMP, cGMP behaved as a partial agonist and only weakly promoted the active state.

Cell clustering has been long established in the analysis of scRNA-seq data to identify the groups of cells with similar expression profiles.

Existing research has developed deep learning models, such as graph machine learning models and contrastive learning-based models, for cell clustering using scRNA-seq data and has summarized the unsupervised learning of cell clustering into a human-interpretable format. While advances in cell clustering have been profound, we are no closer to finding a simple yet effective framework for learning high-quality representations necessary for robust clustering. In this study, we propose scSimGCL, a novel framework based on the graph contrastive learning paradigm for self-supervised pretraining of graph neural networks. This framework facilitates the generation of high-quality representations crucial for cell clustering. Our scSimGCL incorporates cell-cell graph structure and contrastive learning to enhance the performance of cell clustering. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets suggest the superiority of the proposed scSimGCL. Moreover, clustering assignment analysis confirms the general applicability of scSimGCL, including state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Further, ablation study and hyperparameter analysis suggest the efficacy of our network architecture with the robustness of decisions in the self-supervised learning setting.

As hypothesized, higher velocities in large arteries are associated with an earlier response to a vasodilatory stimulus (cerebrovascular reactivity delay) in the downstream territory.

Such responses could reflect processes that have nothing intrinsically related to linguistic representations, such as domain-general executive function abilities. In order to facilitate the potential use of functional neuroimaging methods to identify the source of different syntactic violations, we conducted an fMRI experiment to identify the brain activation maps associated with two distinct syntactic violation types: phrase structure (created by inverting the order of two adjacent words within a sentence) and subject islands (created by extracting a wh-phrase out of an embedded subject). The comparison of these violations to control sentences surprisingly showed no indication of a generalized violation response, with almost completely divergent activation patterns.

Despite its clinical relevance, the host immune response to LACV is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), cytokines, and chemokines in weanling and adult mice following infection with 5x105 plaque forming units (PFU) of LACV. We observed significant age-related differences in viral titers and survival. Weanling mice demonstrated early disease onset with elevated peripheral viremia, but passive transfer of adult serum, confirmed to have nAbs, to naive weanlings prior to infection completely rescued them from death. Cytokine and chemokine profiling revealed distinct kinetics and age-specific immune responses. Adult mice had increased Th1 cytokines, Th9/Th17/Th22/Treg cytokines, and many chemokines. In contrast, weanlings had higher Th2 cytokines, correlating with symptoms onset. Flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining further demonstrated that weanling mice produced higher levels of IL-4 by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to adults, regardless of infection status. Conversely, LACV-infected adult mice had increased IFN-{gamma} production by CD8+ T cells compared to uninfected adults. Finally, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from immune adult mice to naive weanlings delayed neurological symptoms and improved survival, highlighting the protective role of immune adult cells against LACV. In conclusion, this study links nAbs and cytokine and chemokine responses to protective immunity in adult mice, contrasting with the pathogenesis seen in weanlings.

Understanding the mechanism by which locally developed tau pathology propagates throughout the brain is crucial for comprehending AD pathogenesis. Therefore, a novel model of tau pathology that artificially induces tau aggregation in targeted cells at specific times is essential. This study describes a novel optogenetic module, OptoTau, which is a human tau with the P301L mutation fused with a photosensitive protein CRY2olig, inducing various forms of tau according to the temporal pattern of blue light illumination pattern. Continuous blue light illumination for 12 h to Neuro2a cells that stably express OptoTau (OptoTauKI cells) formed clusters along microtubules, many of which eventually accumulated in aggresomes. Conversely, methanol-resistant tau aggregation was formed when alternating light exposure and darkness in 30-min cycles for 8 sets per day were repeated over 8 days. Methanol-resistant tau was induced more rapidly by repeating 5-min illumination followed by 25-min darkness over 24 h. These results indicate that OptoTau induced various tau aggregation stages based on the temporal pattern of blue light exposure.

Here we approach the problem of estimating therapeutic targets for a mutation in mouse muscle using a spatially explicit half sarcomere muscle model. We selected 9 rate parameters in our model linked to both small molecules and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations.

While adaptation is studied extensively in the context of motor control, there is limited evidence that cognitive functions such as working memory are subject to the same error-driven adaptive control mechanism. To examine the possibility that internal spatial representations undergo adaptation, we had participants perform a task that interleaved a perceptual discrimination task and a spatial working memory task. Perceptual discrimination trials (85% of trials) presented an initial peripheral cue to exogenously capture attention, immediately followed by a displaced target stimulus. This sequence of events served to repeatedly induce a covert attentional allocation error. Interleaved spatial working memory trials (15% of trials) presented a stimulus at a pseudorandom peripheral location followed by a delay interval. On half of the working memory trials, the stimulus was surreptitiously presented at the same location as the initial attentional cue. We found that as attentional errors accumulated over the course of the experiment, participants spatial recall shifted to counteract the attentional error. The magnitude of this shift was proportional to the number of induced errors. Recall performance rapidly recovered following the offset of error trials. Multiple control experiments ruled out alternative explanations for these results, such as oculomotor confounds and attentional biases unrelated to error.

However, it is an open question whether predictions of sustained attention are specific to the perceptual modality in which they are trained. In the current study we test whether connectome-based models predict performance on attention tasks performed in different modalities. We show first that a predefined network trained to predict adults' visual sustained attention performance generalizes to predict auditory sustained attention performance in three independent datasets (N1=29, N2=60, N3=17). Next, we train new network models to predict performance on visual and auditory attention tasks separately. We find that functional networks are largely modality-general, with both model-unique and shared model features predicting sustained attention performance in independent datasets regardless of task modality.

Over the last half-century, attempts have been made to elucidate these mechanisms in vivo, primarily focusing on the motor unit (MU) activity because of its role as the smallest voluntarily contractible unit. Although it is firmly established that the nervous system controls muscle force by modulating MU activity, it is yet possible to distinguish between the activities of slow- and fast-twitch MUs non-invasively, which is important for rehabilitation and diagnostic purposes. Although different methods exist to extract MU twitch parameters from a force signal, no method can accurately identify a single MU twitch given a single MU spike train. We addressed this problem by developing a model-based deconvolution method. We evaluated the method using a MU-based recruitment model under isometric contractions and tested it on experimental data. We found that the deconvolution method can provide non-biased average twitch parameter estimates with low variance for the latest recruited MUs, irrespective of contraction level. It can estimate average twitch parameters when the underlying MUs comprise unequal successive twitch profiles, the force signal has lower signal-to-noise ratios, or when the spike train includes missed firings at the cost of slightly increased bias or variance. Finally, the method provides twitch parameter estimates that align with the expected MU recruitment characteristics in experimental conditions. To conclude, the deconvolution method may be used to study slow and fast MUs for rehabilitation and neuromuscular diagnostics.\n\nAuthor SummaryTo generate force voluntarily with a specific muscle, the brain plans and sends signals through the spinal cord via motor neurons, each of which communicates with a set of muscle fibres. Together, these muscle fibres and the motor neuron are called a motor unit. In the literature, the neural signals have received much attention, whereas the mechanical force-generating muscle fibres have received much less due to the limitations of current methods. By extracting the mechanical characteristics of these muscle fibres connected to a specific motor neuron type in vivo, one can use this information for rehabilitation and neuromuscular diagnostics of humans. Here, we proposed a method that can accurately estimate the force profile from each motor unit during low to high contraction levels. This method can be used for rehabilitation and neuromuscular diagnostics purposes.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.05.14.594148", "title": "CLEAN-Contact: Contrastive Learning-enabled Enzyme Functional Annotation Prediction with Structural Inference", "authors": "Yang, Y.; Jerger, A.; Feng, S.; Wang, Z.; Brasfield, C.; Cheung, M.

Surprisingly little is known about microglial mitochondria in vivo and whether they play similar roles in regulating microglial capacity to alter cellular phenotype.

Microglial mitochondria were also altered within hours of LPS injections and microglial expression of inflammation-, trophic-, and phagocytosis-relevant genes was strongly correlated with expression levels of specific mitochondria-relevant genes. Finally, direct genetic manipulation of microglial mitochondria altered microglial morphology and led to brain-region specific effects on microglial gene expression.

A striking example of somatic evolution is the VEXAS (Vacuoles E1 enzyme X-linked Autoinflammatory Somatic) syndrome, caused by somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), inducing treatment-refractory, systemic inflammation. However, the mechanisms that lead to survival and expansion of mutant HSCs are unknown, limiting the development of effective therapies. The lack of animal or cellular models of UBA1-mutant HSCs has hindered such mechanistic understanding, mandating analysis of primary human VEXAS samples, which harbor admixtures of wild-type and UBA1-mutant HSCs. To address these challenges, we applied single-cell multi-omics to comprehensively define mutant UBA1-induced transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and signaling pathway alterations in VEXAS patients, allowing for the direct comparison of mutant versus wild-type cells within the same environment. We confirmed the expected enrichment of UBA1M41V/T mutations in myeloid cells, and additionally discovered that these mutations were also prevalent in Natural Killer (NK) cells in VEXAS patients, providing new insights into disease phenotypes. Through mapping genotypes to molecular phenotypes, including transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, cell surface protein or intracellular protein profiles, in HSCs, we found that UBA1M41V/T-mutant cells showed an increased inflammation signature (interferon alpha and gamma response pathways), as well as activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) via pro-survival, but not pro-apoptotic, mediators of the PERK pathway, compared to UBA1 wild-type HSCs. Ex vivo validation experiments showed that inhibiting UBA1 in normal CD34+ or using UBA1-mutant HSCs led to PERK pathway up-regulation, increased myeloid differentiation and cell survival, which was reversed by PERK inhibition. Thus, we demonstrated that human VEXAS HSCs show cell-intrinsic inflammatory phenotypes and survive the proteomic stress caused by compromised ubiquitination through PERK-mediated activation of the UPR. Together, these analyses nominate PERK pathway inhibition as a potential new therapeutic strategy for eradicating the VEXAS-inducing clone, demonstrating the power of single-cell multi-omics profiling of primary patient sample to enable genotype-to-phenotype somatic mapping for the discovery of novel candidates for clinical intervention.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.05.20.595075", "title": "Discriminating neural ensemble patterns through dendritic computations in randomly connected feedforward networks", "authors": "Somashekar, B.

Using rat hippocampal and cortical network statistics, we show that clustered convergence of axons from 3-4 different co-active ensembles is likely even in randomly connected networks, leading to representation of arbitrary input combinations in at least ten target neurons in a 100,000 population. In the presence of larger ensembles, spatiotemporally ordered convergence of 3-5 axons from temporally ordered ensembles is also likely. These active clusters result in higher neuronal activation in the presence of strong dendritic nonlinearities and low background activity. We mathematically and computationally demonstrate a tight interplay between network connectivity, spatiotemporal scales of subcellular electrical and chemical mechanisms, dendritic nonlinearities, and uncorrelated background activity.

In other words, pupillometry provides an integrated readout of several distinct networks, but it is unclear whether each has a specific fingerprint, stemming from its function or physiological substrate. Here we show that phasic changes in pupil size are inherently low-dimensional, with modes that are highly consistent across behavioral tasks of very different nature, suggesting that these changes occur along pupillary manifolds that are highly constrained by the underlying physiological structures rather than functions.

We therefore introduce the notion of pupillary manifolds as latent spaces that subtend the generative processes behind these changes.

Ex vivo acute striatal brain preparations are widely employed to study the regulation of evoked DA release but exhibit very different DA release kinetics than in vivo recordings. To investigate the relationship between phasic and tonic neuronal activity, we stimulated the slice in patterns intended to mimic tonic activity, which were interrupted by a series of burst stimuli. Conditioning the striatal slice with low-frequency activity altered DA release triggered by high-frequency bursts and produced kinetic parameters that resemble those in vivo. In the absence of applied tonic activity, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists had no significant effect on neurotransmitter release driven by repeated burst activity in the striatal brain slice. In contrast, in tonically stimulated slices, D2 receptor blockade decreased the amount of DA released during a single burst and facilitated DA release in subsequent bursts. This experimental system provides a means to reconcile the difference in the kinetics of DA release ex vivo and in vivo and provides a novel approach to more accurately emulate pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms that control axonal DA release in vivo.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/595411v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e9412corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5cce4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ebabforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f66982_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.05.23.595557", "title": "Subtilase SBT5.2 inactivates flagellin immunogenicity in the plant apoplast", "authors": "Buscaill, P.; Sanguankiattichai, N.; Kaschani, F.; Huang, J.; Mooney, B.

Here, we demonstrate the extracellular subtilase SBT5.2 not only releases flg22, but also inactivates the immunogenicity of flagellin and flg22 by cleaving within the flg22 epitope, consistent with previous reports that flg22 is unstable in the apoplast.

The {beta} subunit of integrin interacts with the FERM-folded head domain of talin through an N-P-x-Y/F motif, triggering integrin activation. Although this motif is conserved across most integrin-{beta} subunits, the precise molecular mechanisms governing talins selective recognition of different integrin species remains unclear. We determined the crystal structure of talin head in complex with the {beta}2-integrin tail. The structure reveals a two-mode configuration featuring a \"rocking\" motion of the talin head FERM domain compared with its interaction with {beta}3 integrin, resulting in distinct inter-subdomain interactions and unique cavities. Switching of the talin:{beta}2 binding mode to the talin:{beta}3 binding mode enhances {beta}2-integrin affinity and boosts LFA-1-mediated natural killer cell cytotoxicity.

This occurs despite noted advances in surgical care in the past 50 years. Mitochondrial oxidative damage pathways initiate PTOA after severe injuries like intraarticular fracture that often require surgery and contribute to PTOA after less severe injuries that may or may not require surgery like meniscal injuries. When considering the mitochondrial and redox environment of the injured joint, we hypothesized that activation of heme metabolism, previously associated with healing in many settings, would cause prototypic mitochondrial reprogramming effects in cartilage ideally suited for use at the time of injury repair. Activation of heme metabolism can be accomplished through the gasotransmitter carbon monoxide (CO), which activates hemeoxygenase-1 (HO1) and subsequent heme metabolism. In this study, we employed unique carbon monoxide (CO)-containing foam (COF) to stimulate heme metabolism and restore chondrocyte oxygen metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Doxycycline-inducible, chondrocyte-specific HO1 overexpressing transgenic mice show similar mitochondrial reprogramming after induction compared to COF. CO is retained at least 24 h after COF injection into stifle joints and induces sustained increases in heme metabolism. Lastly, intraarticular injection of COF causes key redox outcomes without any adverse safety outcomes in rabbit stifle joints ex vivo and in vivo. We propose that activation of heme metabolism is an ideal adjuvant to trauma care that replenishes chondrocyte mitochondrial metabolism and restores redox homeostasis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.05.28.596134", "title": "The External Microbiome Communicates with the Developing Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Embryo Through the Chorion and Influences Developmental Trajectory", "authors": "Green, E.

Close to the bifurcation, the system is intrinsically invariant to signal variance, and information about the timing, duration, and intensity of odor fluctuations is transferred efficiently.

The reliability of these IDPs has been extensively explored, mainly focusing on the inter-subject variations, whereas the stability of the within-subject variations has often been overlooked. Additionally, how environmental factors such as time of day and daylight hours impact the structural brain is poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to address the stability of T1w-derived phenotypes and explore the effecting factors including processing stream, brain region size, time of day, daylight hours, and head movement.\n\nThree subjects in their late 20s, early 30s, and early 40s were scanned repeatedly on the same scanner over one year, from which a densely sampled dataset was acquired with 38, 40, and 25 sessions for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The effects of time of day and daylight hours were assessed by fitting general linear models, aggregating the effect size with meta-analysis, and equivalent analysis.\n\nThe longitudinal processing stream generates more stable results than the cross-sectional processing stream, hence the following results are all derived from the longitudinal processing stream. First and foremost, most IDPs demonstrated percentage changes within 5% and CVs within 2% for almost all brain regions, indicating high stability. Interestingly, we found that the brain region size negatively correlates with the CVs. Specifically, several small brain regions, including the temporal pole, frontal pole, pericalcarine, entorhinal cortex, and accumbens area, showed low stability. In addition, cortical thickness change was strongly and positively correlated with that of volume change while being negatively correlated with change in surface area, illustrating their distinct roles in brain anatomy. Moreover, the time of day could be ignored when evaluating the total surface area and total cortical brain volume but not the average cortical thickness and total subcortical brain volume. Furthermore, daylight hours could be left out when evaluating IDPs since there was no appreciable effect of daylight hours on the IDPs stability.

Identification and removal of the seizure onset site, termed the epileptogenic zone (EZ), is the most successful treatment to stop seizures in these people. Implanting electrodes into the brain to record intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is the gold standard test for identifying the EZ. But identification of the EZ with iEEG remains challenging in many cases. We developed a novel methodology using a stacked random forest ensemble machine learning model integrating power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high gamma frequencies over time to identify the EZ. In patients who were seizure-free after surgery, electrodes within the EZ showed significantly higher area under the curve for mean power over time in the first 20 seconds after a seizure compared to electrodes outside the EZ in the alpha (p = 0.0272), beta (p = 0.0263), gamma (p = 0.0013), and high gamma (p = 0.0086) ranges. Additionally, electrodes within the EZ in patients that became seizure-free after surgery had significantly higher AUC compared to electrodes marked within the EZ in patients who did not become seizure-free after surgery in the gamma (p = 0.0145) and high gamma (p = 0.0024) power ranges, but not delta (p=0.8678), theta (p=0.4956), alpha (p=0.1320) or beta (p=0.1624) ranges.

We aimed to eliminate this burden using advanced on-paddle electronics.\n\nApproachWe developed a smart EES paddle with a 60-electrode programmable array, addressable using an active electronic multiplexer embedded within the electrode paddle body. The electronics are sealed in novel, ultra-low profile hermetic packaging. We conducted extensive reliability testing on the novel array, including a battery of ISO 10993-1 biocompatibility tests and determination of the hermetic package leak rate. We then evaluated the EES device in vivo, placed on the epidural surface of the ovine lumbosacral spinal cord for 15 months.\n\nMain resultsThe active paddle array performed nominally when implanted in sheep for over 15 months and no device-related malfunctions were observed. The onboard multiplexer enabled bespoke electrode arrangements across, and within, experimental sessions.

Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs.

Preservation of methylated cytosines in the promoters of these genes significantly reduced their expression, which was confirmed by western blot analysis. This impaired expression leads to the underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in the photoreceptors of TET-deficient retinas, which results in loss of rod and cone function, as assayed by ERG.

This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood--and addressed--as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects--namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution.

Theoretical work to analyze these plasticity models has largely focused on abstract issues, such as the conditions under which they may promote synchronization and the weight distributions induced by inputs with simple correlation structures, rather than on scenarios associated with specific tasks, and has generally not considered dopamine-dependent forms of STDP. In this paper we introduce three forms of dopamine-modulated STDP adapted from previously proposed plasticity rules. We then analyze, mathematically and with simulations, their performance in three biologically relevant scenarios. We test the ability of each of the three models to maintain its weights in the face of noise and to complete simple reward prediction and action selection tasks, studying the learned weight distributions and corresponding task performance in each setting. Interestingly, we find that each plasticity rule is well suited to a subset of the scenarios studied but falls short in others.

Vowels elicit early (< 100 ms) sustained processing negativity (SPN) in the auditory cortex that reflects the detection of an acoustic pattern based on the presence of formant structure and/or periodic envelope information (f0) and its transformation into an auditory \"object\".\n\nMethodsWe used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and individual brain models to investigate whether SPN is altered in children with ASD and whether this deficit is associated with impairment in their ability to perceive speech in the background of noise. MEG was recorded while boys with ASD and typically developing boys passively listened to sounds that differed in the presence/absence of f0 periodicity and formant structure. Word-in-noise perception was assessed in the separate psychoacoustic experiment using stationary and amplitude modulated noise with varying signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nResultsSPN was present in both groups with similarly early onset. In children with ASD, SPN associated with processing formant structure was reduced predominantly in the cortical areas lateral to and medial to the primary auditory cortex, starting at [~] 150 - 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In the left hemisphere, this deficit correlated with impaired ability of children with ASD to recognize words in amplitude-modulated noise, but not in stationary noise\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that perceptual grouping of vowel formants into phonemes is impaired in children with ASD and that, in the left hemisphere, this deficit contributes to their difficulties with speech perception in fluctuating background noise.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.06.28.601215", "title": "Giant transposons promote strain heterogeneity in a major fungal pathogen", "authors": "Gluck-Thaler, E.; Forsythe, A.; Puerner, C.; Stajich, J.

Studying amphibian biology through the genomics lens increases our understanding of the features of this animal class and that of other terrestrial vertebrates. The need for amphibian genomic resources is more urgent than ever due to the increasing threats to this group. Amphibians are one of the most imperiled taxonomic groups, with approximately 41% of species threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, changes in land use patterns, disease, climate change, and their synergistic effects. Amphibian genomic resources have provided a better understanding of ontogenetic diversity, tissue regeneration, diverse life history and reproductive modes, anti-predator strategies, and resilience and adaptive responses. They also serve as essential models for studying broad genomic traits, such as evolutionary genome expansions and contractions, as they exhibit the widest range of genome sizes among all animal taxa and possess multiple mechanisms of genetic sex determination. Despite these features, genome sequencing of amphibians has significantly lagged behind that of other vertebrates, primarily due to the challenges of assembling their large, repeat-rich genomes and the relative lack of societal support. The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, combined with advanced molecular and computational techniques that improve scaffolding and reduce computational workloads, is now making it possible to address some of these challenges. To promote and accelerate the production and use of amphibian genomics research through international coordination and collaboration, we launched the Amphibian Genomics Consortium (AGC, https://mvs.unimelb.edu.au/amphibian-genomics-consortium) in early 2023. This burgeoning community already has more than 282 members from 41 countries. The AGC aims to leverage the diverse capabilities of its members to advance genomic resources for amphibians and bridge the implementation gap between biologists, bioinformaticians, and conservation practitioners.

These latter proteins would be expected to possess a signature marking them out for translocation but, to date, no such signature has been identified. An examination of a set of wheat rust proteins known to be translocated to the cytoplasm of the wheat cell, together with an analysis of 1208 wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) secretome proteins, provides evidence that the translocation signature contains two components. The first component consists of a positively-charged amino acid at position 1, 2 or 3 (and possibly 4 or greater) upstream of the hydrophobic region in the signal peptide. The second component consists of a positively-charged amino acid at position 21 downstream of the signal peptide. A similar analysis of flax rust (Melampsora lini) secretome proteins indicates that the first component is the same as that of the wheat stem rust secretome proteins but that the second component consists of a positively-charged amino acid at position (16)17-20 downstream of the signal peptide. The flax rust signature may also be employed by wheat stem rust in its pycnial stage when growing on its alternate dicot host, barberry.

The representation of target features is referred to as the \"attentional\" or \"target\" template and is thought to be encoded within an IFJ-visual cortical network (Baldauf & Desimone, 2014; Bichot et al., 2015b). The contents of the template typically contain veridical target information that is used to modulate sensory processing in preparation for guiding attention during search. However, many behavioral studies have shown that target-associated information is used to guide attention, especially when target discrimination is difficult (Battistoni et al., 2017; de Lange et al., 2018; Peelen et al., 2024; Vo et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2023; Zhou & Geng, 2024). Thus, while target-associated information is known to impact search performance, its presence within the IFJ-visual attentional network during the preparatory period has never been demonstrated. Here, we use fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, to test if attentional guidance by target-associated information is explicitly represented in the preparatory period before search begins, either in conjunction with the target or even in place of it. Participants were first trained on four face-scene category pairings after which they completed a cued visual search task for the same faces. Each trial began with a face cue, followed by a delay period, and then a search display with two lateralized faces superimposed on scene images. The critical results showed that while face information could be decoded in the fusiform face area (FFA), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC), during the cue period, face information could not be decoded in any brain regions during the delay period. In contrast, the associated scene was decoded only in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) during the cue period but most importantly, in the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) during the delay period.

This would allow us to develop a fusion inhibitor that might work against a larger spectrum of enveloped viruses as it does not target any specific viral fusion protein.

One such tactic involves acquiring functional copies of host genes encoding cytokines such as IL-6 (HHV-8), IL-10 (HHV-4, HHV-5), and IL-17 (SaHV-2). These viral mimics, or virokines, can bind to cellular receptors, modulating the natural cytokine signaling to manipulate the immune response in favor of the virus or stimulate target cell growth to enhance virus replication. In the course of full-length cDNA sequencing of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) transcripts, a previously unknown highly-spliced gene was discovered in the viral genome predicted to encode a 147 amino acid protein with similarity to vertebrate interleukin-4. The three-intron gene structure was precisely conserved with chicken and other vertebrate IL-4 homologs, and the amino acid sequence displayed structural conservation with vertebrate homologs at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels based on computational modeling. The viral IL-4 gene was subsequently identified in all sequenced ILTV genomes. Phylogenetic analyses, along with the conserved gene structure, suggested direct capture from a Galliformes host. Functionally, an LPS-stimulation assay showed that the expressed viral IL-4 homolog stimulated nitric oxide production in a macrophage cell line at comparable levels to recombinant chicken IL-4. A recombinant virus lacking vIL-4 exhibited slightly higher titers in cell culture compared to the parental strain.

Research suggests that a reduction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons activity in the hippocampus by beta-amyloid peptide (A{beta}) is a crucial trigger for cognitive impairment in AD via hyperexcitability. Therefore, enhancing hippocampal inhibition is thought to be protective against AD. However, hippocampal inhibitory cells are highly diverse, and these distinct interneuron subtypes differentially regulate hippocampal inhibitory circuits and cognitive processes. Moreover, A{beta} unlikely affects all subtypes of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus equally. Hence, identifying the affected interneuron subtypes in AD to enhance hippocampal inhibition optimally is conceptually and practically challenging. We have previously found that A{beta} selectively binds to two of the three major hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes, 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs, but not 3{beta}4-nAChRs, and inhibits these two receptors in cultured hippocampal inhibitory interneurons to decrease their activity, leading to hyperexcitation and synaptic dysfunction in excitatory neurons. We have also revealed that co-activation of 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs is required to reverse the A{beta}-induced adverse effects in hippocampal excitatory neurons. Here, we discover that 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs predominantly control the nicotinic cholinergic signaling and neuronal activity in hippocampal parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) inhibitory interneurons, respectively. Furthermore, we reveal that co-activation of these receptors is necessary to reverse hippocampal network dysfunction and fear memory loss in the amyloid pathology model mice. We thus suggest that co-activation of PV+ and SST+ cells is a novel strategy to reverse hippocampal dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.07.08.602194", "title": "Selective Activation of GPCRs: Molecular Dynamics Shows Siponimod Binds but Fails to Activate S1PR2 Unlike S1PR1", "authors": "Soniya, K.; Nanduru, C.; Halder, A.", "author_corresponding": "Kumari Soniya", "author_corresponding_institution": "Aganitha Cognitive Solutions", "date": "2024-10-06", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/06/2024.07.08.602194.source.xml", "abstract": "Understanding drug selectivity is crucial for designing effective medications that target specific proteins while minimizing off-target interactions, thus optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

In this study, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation methods have been used to examine the selective modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) over S1PR2 by Siponimod, an FDA-approved drug for Multiple Sclerosis. Both S1PR1 and S1PR2 belong to the same sub-family of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). Contrary to the previous hypothesis based on molecular docking, MD simulations showed that Siponimod can bind to S1PR2 with an in silico-determined affinity comparable to that of S1PR1. Comparing the dynamics of Siponimod-bound S1PR2 with S1P-bound S1PR2 revealed that the transmission switches necessary for downstream biological activity are activated by S1P but not by Siponimod, whereas both S1P and Siponimod activate those transmission switches in S1PR1. A few crucial residues in S1PR2 were also identified that can be leveraged to optimize molecules to bind selectively to S1PR1 over S1PR2.

This work explores the kinetic characteristics of three closely related Dehalobacter chloroalkane-reductases--TmrA, CfrA, and AcdA--and identifies differences between their activity on chloroform (CF), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), and 1,1,2-TCA.

AcdA is the most sensitive to substrate inhibition by CF and 1,1,2-TCA, and inhibition by a common co-contaminant trichloroethene. Finally, the reduction of 1,1,2-TCA, which can produce both 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, was assessed for each enzyme. Interestingly, each enzyme has a distinct preference for the major product it produces, indicating a favoured reaction pathway.

We show that AlphaFold3 is capable of producing amyloid-like assemblies that have significant similarity to experimental structures (TM-score>0.5), although its results are impacted by the number of monomers forming the predicted fibril and a protein of choice. AlphaFold3 produces structurally diverse models of some amyloid proteins, which could reflect their polymorphism observed in nature. We hypothesize that the lower emphasis on multiple sequence analysis (MSA) in AlphaFold3 improves the results quality, since for this class of proteins sequence homology may be misleading in their structural similarity. However, the structural landscape obtained from the modeling does not reflect the real one governed by thermodynamics. Finally, AlphaFold3 enables for the first time, structural modeling of fibril-like structures to a certain extent, possibly including their polymorphic nature.

While the severe hereditary erythrocytosis mutant R2456H significantly slows down the inactivation of hPIEZO1, the hPIEZO1-R2456H-MDFIC complex shows a more curved and contracted structure with an inner helix twist due to the broken link between the pore lipid and R2456H.

Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a short oligomer to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the problem of erroneous products can be mitigated if only monomers are activated, such that each ligation involves at least one monomer. Surprisingly, in such systems, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon which has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior, and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers.

There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naive animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection.

Linkage mapping associating dicamba injury with genotype derived from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing identified a single locus in the kochia genome associated with resistance on chromosome 4. A mutant version of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 16 (AUX/IAA16; a gene previously implicated in dicamba resistance in kochia) was found near the middle of this locus in resistant plants. Long read sequencing of dicamba-resistant plants identified a recently inserted Ty1/Copia retrotransposon near the beginning of the second exon of AUX/IAA16, leading to disruption of normal splicing. A molecular marker for this insertion allows for rapid detection of resistance. Stable transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana ectopically expressing the mutant and wildtype alleles of AUX/IAA16 were developed. Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the mutant AUX/IAA16 allele grew shorter roots on control media. However, transgenic root growth was less inhibited on media containing either dicamba (5 M) or IAA (0.5 M) when compared to non-transgenic plants or those expressing the wildtype allele of AUX/IAA16. In vitro assays indicate reduced binding affinity and more rapid dissociation of the mutant AUX/IAA with TIR1 in the presence of several auxins, and protein modeling suggests the substitution of the glycine residue in the degron domain of AUX/IAA16 is especially important for resistance. A fitness cost associated with the mutant allele of AUX/IAA16 has implications for resistance evolution and management of kochia populations with this resistance mechanism.\n\nSignificanceAuxin mimics are amongst the most important herbicides in modern agriculture.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), this study investigated the dynamics of the content and geometry reflected on the neural patterns of control representations during novel instructed behavior. We designed a verbal instruction paradigm where each trial involved novel combinations of multi-component task information. By manipulating three task-relevant factors, we observed multiplexed coding throughout the trial, during both preparation and implementation stages. The temporal profiles were consistent with a hierarchical structure: whereas task information was active in a sustained manner, the coding of more concrete stimulus features was more transient. Data showed both high dimensionality and abstraction, particularly during instruction encoding and target processing. Our results suggest that whenever task content could be recovered from neural patterns of activity, there was evidence of abstract coding, with an underlying geometry that favored generalization. During target processing, where potential interference across factors increased, orthogonal configurations also appeared.

To examine how birds target and land successfully on moving supports, we investigated how peach-faced lovebirds (Agapornis roseicollis) approach and land on a swinging perch. Lovebirds were trained to take off from a hand-held perch and fly ~6 m to land on a servo-controlled swinging perch, driven at three sinusoidal frequencies, in a purpose-built flight corridor. Lovebird flight and landing kinematics were recorded using a motion capture system. A force-torque sensor mounted to the landing perch recorded the bird's horizontal and vertical landing force and pitch torque. In support of our hypothesis for stable landings, lovebirds timed their landings in a majority of trials (51.3%), when the perch was approaching either extreme of its motion with its velocity nearing zero (27.5% in the same direction as the bird's approach -- SDs, and 23.8% in the opposite direction to the bird's approach -- ODs). As a result, lovebirds exhibited a robust bimodal strategy for timing their landing to the phase of the swinging perch. Less commonly, lovebirds landed when the perch was moving at high velocity either toward the bird's approach (12.3%) or in the same direction as the bird's approach (11.5%); with the remainder (21.9%) of trials distributed over a broad range of swing phases. Landing forces were greatest in the horizontal plane, with vertical forces more varied and of smaller magnitude across all landing conditions. This reflected the shallow flight trajectory (center of mass approach angle: -13.2 {+/-}3.0{degrees} SEM relative to horizontal) that the lovebirds adopted to decelerate and land. Increased landing force correlated with greater landing speed of the bird relative to the perch (R2 = 0.4296, p < 0.0001). The lovebirds initiated landing with a consistent body pitch angle (81.9 {+/-} 0.46{degrees} SEM relative to horizontal) across all landing conditions, using the horizontal perch reaction force to assist in braking when landing. Correspondingly, the landing angle of the feet relative to the perch support was 56.9 {+/-} 2.8{degrees}. Subsequent head-down body pitch rotation of the bird after landing was not well correlated and generally opposite to the initial direction and magnitude of landing pitch torque, which was generally negative due to foot rotation and ankle flexion at landing. Flexion of the birds' hind limb joints (ankle: -29.2 {+/-} 9.2{degrees}, knee: -13.6 {+/-} 7.4{degrees}, and hip: -4.0 {+/-} 3.4{degrees} at landing, combined with their horizontal approach trajectory, reduced the magnitude of landing torque by aligning the bird's center of mass trajectory more closely to the landing perch (3.61 {+/-} 0.21 cm) than if they landed from above the perch. Landing pitch torque and body pitch rotation also increased uniformly in response to increased perch swing frequency. In contrast to landing forces, landing pitch torque was more varied across landing conditions, as well as in relation to the phase of landing. In general, higher landing force was encountered when the perch was moving towards the approaching bird. Our results indicate that lovebirds regulate their approach trajectory and velocity to time the phase of landing to a moving perch, providing insight for designing biologically-inspired unmanned aerial vehicles capable of landing on moving targets.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.07.22.604571", "title": "Evaluating the Anti-tumor efficacy and safety of AEV01 in Glioma and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An In Vitro and In Vivo approach.", "authors": "Biswas, I.; Precilla, D.; Kumar, A.; MM, S.; Medasani, R.; T.

The resulting biomolecular condensates play an important role in cell cycle protein function and may be involved in development of persister cells tolerant to antibiotics. Here we report that the E. coli chromosomal Ter macrodomain organizer MatP, a division site selection protein implicated in the coordination of chromosome segregation with cell division, forms biomolecular condensates in cytomimetic systems. These condensates are favored by crowding and preferentially localize at the membrane of microfluidics droplets, a behavior probably mediated by MatP-lipid binding. Condensates are negatively regulated and partially dislodged from the membrane by DNA sequences recognized by MatP (matS), which partition into them. Unexpectedly, MatP condensation is enhanced by FtsZ, a core component of the division machinery previously described to undergo phase separation. Our biophysical analyses uncover a direct interaction between the two proteins, disrupted by matS sequences. This binding might have implications for FtsZ ring positioning at mid-cell by the Ter linkage, which comprises MatP and two other proteins that bridge the canonical MatP/FtsZ interaction. FtsZ/MatP condensates interconvert with bundles in response to GTP addition, providing additional levels of regulation. Consistent with discrete foci reported in cells, MatP biomolecular condensates may facilitate MatP's role in chromosome organization and spatiotemporal regulation of cytokinesis and DNA segregation. Moreover, sequestration of MatP in these membraneless compartments, with or without FtsZ, could promote cell entry into dormant states that are able to survive antibiotic treatments.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.07.23.604769", "title": "PA28\u03b3 promotes the malignant progression of tumor by elevating mitochondrial function via C1QBP", "authors": "Wang, J.; Shi, Y.; Wang, Y.; Shen, Y.; Liu, H.; Sun, S.; Wang, Y.; Zhou, X.; Zhou, Y.; Zeng, X.; Li, J.; Chen, Q.", "author_corresponding": "Jing Li", "author_corresponding_institution": "Sichuan University", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "cancer biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.07.23.604769.source.xml", "abstract": "Proteasome activator 28{gamma} (PA28{gamma}) plays a critical role in malignant progression of various tumors, however, its role and regulation are not well understood.

Within green plants, the derived condition of heterosporous reproduction has emerged from the ancestral condition of homospory in disparate locations on the phylogenetic tree at least 11 times, of which 3 lineages are extant. In all green plant lineages where heterospory has emerged, there has been a significant downsizing in chromosome numbers (refer to figure 1). This dynamic has been investigated without clear answers for many decades. In this study, we combine known ideas from existing literature with novel methods, tools, and data to generate fresh insights into an old question. Using gene family evolution models and selection analyses, we identified gene families that have undergone significant expansion, contraction, or selection in heterosporous lineages. Our results reveal both shared and lineage-specific genomic changes associated with the evolution of heterospory. We found expansions in gene families related to developmental regulation, signaling pathways, and stress responses across heterosporous groups. Notably, the MATE efflux family showed consistent expansion and evidence of selection in heterosporous lineages, suggesting a potentially conserved role in heterospory evolution. These findings highlight novel insights that may underpin the association between heterospory and reduced chromosome numbers. The general importance of chromosome numbers, structure, and sizes in cellular biology notwithstanding, the association between the emergence of heterosporous reproduction and chromosome number reduction/genome downsizing is not fully understood. It remains unclear why there exists a dynamic between aspects of biology at such disparate levels as reproductive life-cycles and chromosome numbers/genome size. Exploring and answering this conundrum of evolutionary biology can add to our broader understanding of life sciences and of biology at different levels.

This study examines the relationship between community-defined land use plans and de facto land use practices, and the influence of the latter on the relative abundance and distribution of large wild mammals in a across the Ifakara-Lupiro-Mangula (ILUMA) WMA, which acts as a key buffer zone between Nyerere National Park (NNP) to the east and adjacent stakeholder villages to the north and west. All observed signs of wildlife and human activity were recorded across 32 locations inside ILUMA and in the permanent settlements and national park that respectively border it to the west and east. Across much of ILUMA WMA, in areas where agreed land use plans were not adhered to, rampant cattle herding and land clearing for agriculture were associated with reductions in wildlife richness and biodiversity, as well as overall ecosystem integrity. Although human settlement was also generally associated with reduced natural ecosystem integrity, some important exceptions to this rule illustrate how sustainable livelihoods for local people that are based on well-managed natural resource harvesting practices may actually enhance conservation effectiveness: Three authorised human settlements within the WMA, where fishing was the primary permitted livelihood and local communities collaborated with the WMA management, were surrounded by pristine land cover with thriving terrestrial wildlife populations. Correspondingly, the best conserved parts of the WMA not only included those closest to the boundary with the national park to the east, but also these fishing villages along the riverbank to the north, where compliance with agreed land use plans was most rigorous. Overall, this study documents a useful example of how a devolved conservation area may conditionally host resident local communities undertaking selective natural resource extraction activities and collaborate with them to achieve effective de facto conservation practices.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.07.30.605869", "title": "A Bayesian Hierarchical Model of Trial-to-Trial Fluctuations in Decision Criterion", "authors": "Vloeberghs, R.; Urai, A.

We then present a hierarchical estimation procedure capable of reliably recovering the underlying state of the fluctuating decision criterion with as few as 500 trials per participant, offering a robust tool for researchers with typical human datasets. Critically, hMFC does not only accurately recover the state of the underlying decision criterion, it also effectively deals with the confounds caused by criterion fluctuations.

This variability can stem from gene expression noise and/or unequal partitioning of low-copy-number freely diffusing proteins during cell division. Some high-copy-number components are transiently associated with almost immobile large assemblies (hyperstructures) and may be unequally distributed, contributing to bacterial phenotypic variability. We focus on the nucleoid hyperstructure containing numerous DNA-associated proteins, including the replication initiator DnaA. Previously we found an increasing asynchrony in the nucleoid segregation dynamics in growing E. coli cell lineages and suggested that variable replication initiation timing may be the main cause of this phenomenon. Here we support this hypothesis revealing that DnaA/DNA variability represents a key factor leading to the enhanced asynchrony in E. coli. We followed the intra- and intercellular distribution of fluorescently tagged DnaA and histone-like HU chromosomally encoded under their native promoters. The diffusion rate of DnaA is low, corresponding to a diffusion-binding mode of mobility, but still one order faster than that of HU. The intracellular distribution of DnaA concentration is homogeneous in contrast to the significant asymmetry in the distribution of HU to the cell halves, leading to unequal DNA content of nucleoids and DnaA/DNA ratios in future daughter compartments. Accordingly, the intercellular variabilities of HU concentration (CV=26%) and DnaA/DNA ratio (CV=18%) are high. The variable DnaA/DNA may cause a variable replication initiation time (initiation noise). Asynchronous initiation at different replication origins may, in turn, be the mechanism leading to the observed asymmetric intracellular DNA distribution. Our findings indicate that the feature determining the variability of initiation time in E. coli is the DnaA/DNA ratio rather than separately each of them.

The tendency toward short connections is widely believed to explain the existence of such an organization in the brains of many animals. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we use artificial deep neural network models to demonstrate that a topographical organization akin to that in the primary, intermediate, and high-level human visual cortex emerges when units in these models are locally laterally connected and their weight parameters are tuned by top-down credit assignment. The emergence of modular organization without explicit topography-inducing learning rules or objective functions challenges their necessity and suggests that local lateral connectivity alone may suffice for the formation of topographic organization across the cortex.

While these responses are documented, both the duration of the refractory period to repeated stressors and the role of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in specific phases of the glucocorticoid negative feedback are still being clarified. We explored these questions using water vortices as stressors, combined with GR blockage and measurements of whole-body cortisol in zebrafish larvae subjected to single and repeated stress protocols. Cortisol levels were elevated 10 minutes after stress onset and returned to baseline within 30-40 minutes, depending on the stressor strength. In response to homotypic stress, cortisol levels rose above baseline if the second stressor occurred 60 or 120 minutes after the first, but not with a 30-minute interval. This suggests a rapid cortisol-mediated feedback loop with a refractory period of at least 30 minutes. Treatment with a GR blocker delayed the return to baseline and suppressed the refractory period, indicating GR-dependent early-phase feedback regulation. These findings are consistent with mammalian models and provide a framework for further analyses of early-life cortisol responses and feedback in zebrafish larvae, ideal for non-invasive imaging and high-throughput screening.\n\nSummary statementThis study investigates cortisol responses in zebrafish larvae to acute stress, revealing a rapid feedback loop and the glucocorticoid receptors role, offering insights for future research in stress biology.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.07.607009", "title": "Outer hair cells stir cochlear fluids", "authors": "Lee, C.; Shokrian, M.; Henry, K.

Based on intensive plant samplings performed in Spain, Italy and Morocco at different periods between the 1990s and 2014, several begomoviruses (family Geminiviridae) were identified as the cause of TYLCD. They comprise the native Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV), two strains of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) introduced from the Middle East, and several types of TYLCV/TYLCSV recombinants including the invasive recombinant TYLCV-IS76 in which the proportion of genome inherited from TYLCSV was unusually short. Although parental and recombinant TYLCD-associated begomoviruses were present in each country, country specificities were detected with respect to their relative prevalence, the infection profiles of individual tomato plants, and the recombination patterns of TYLCV/TYLCSV recombinants. Considering geographic proximities and trade activities between these countries, and the efficient transmission of begomoviruses which are persistently transmitted by the polyphagous and tiny whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci, it was not known if these specificities would be maintained over time. To address this question, tomato samples collected in the three countries between 2015 and 2019 were analysed with PCR tests previously designed to distinguish species, strains and recombinants of TYLCD associated begomoviruses, and with an original PCR test distinguishing emerging resistance-breaking recombinants bearing short TYLCSV-inherited fragments (Srec) from formerly reported recombinants with longer TYLCSV fragments (Lrec). The results show that country specificities are still present, the most striking being the contrasted geographic distribution of Srec recombinants, with TYLCV-IS76 detected in Morocco but not in Italy, and TYLCV-IS141 and a new Srec recombinant (TYLCV-IS60) both detected in Italy and not in Morocco. Nevertheless, besides country specificities, a general population shift was revealed regarding TYLCV/TYLCSV recombinants. Indeed, all the recombinant positive samples, irrespective of their geographic origin, were Srec-positive but Lrec-negative, which suggest that the emergence of Srec recombinants occurred at the expenses of the Lrec recombinants. These results are discussed in relation to the positive selection of Srec recombinants by Ty-1 resistant tomato plants.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.09.607407", "title": "Pyruvate kinase allostery resist hyperglycemia, obesity and inflammation by inducing TCA vortex and glucose U turn", "authors": "Zhang, X.; Jiang, X.; Wu, X.; Yang, Y.; Wang, J.; Zheng, J.; Zhou, M.; Qian, C.", "author_corresponding": "Chen Qian", "author_corresponding_institution": "Third Military Medical University", "date": "2024-10-06", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "biochemistry", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/06/2024.08.09.607407.source.xml", "abstract": "ATP is the final product of glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

The inhibition of PKM is stronger and longer for CLT while weak and short for ATP.

However, achieving PARP1 or PARP2-selective inhibitors is difficult due to their close structural homology. Selectivity profiling is typically done with purified proteins, but these lack the complexity of intracellular environments and could therefore be inaccurate. Here, we duplex PARP1 L713F-GFP and PARP2 L269A-mCherry CeTEAM drug biosensors to systematically characterize binding and cell cycle alterations of 27 PARPi at the single cell level. Our results reveal that most PARPi are generally equipotent for both PARPs, including the next-generation drug, senaparib. However, benzimidazole carboxamide (niraparib) derivatives demonstrated PARP1-selective tendencies, while pthalazinones (olaparib) favored PARP2. AZD5305, a reported PARP1-selective inhibitor with characteristics of both series, was the exception and appears [~]1600-fold more potent towards PARP1. In agreement with current understanding, we see that PARP trapping phenotypes positively correlate with PARP1/2 binding potency, while some potent binders, such as veliparib, did not - likely reflecting their allosteric influence on DNA retention. We also assessed the effect of the PARP1/2 active site component, HPF1, on intracellular PARPi binding and see that HPF1 depletion elicits slight deviations in apparent binding potency, while contributing additively to PARP-DNA trapping phenotypes. The PARP1/2 CeTEAM platform thus provides a structural roadmap for the development of selective PARPi and should facilitate the discovery of better targeted therapies.

This bias can be mitigated by aligning to pangenome graphs to incorporate documented organismic variation, but this approach still suffers from substitution patterns due to chemical damage. We introduce a novel methodology introducing the RYmer index, a variant of the commonly-used minimizer index which represents purines (A,G) and pyrimidines (C,T) as R and Y respectively. This creates an indexing scheme robust to the aforementioned chemical damage. We implemented SAFARI, an ancient DNA damage-aware version of the pangenome aligner vg giraffe which uses RYmers to rescue alignments containing deaminated seeds. We show that our approach produces more correct alignments from ancient DNA sequences than current approaches while maintaining a tolerable rate of spurious alignments. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm improves the estimate of the rate of ancient DNA damage, especially for highly damaged samples.

Previously, we identified two hypermutator Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolates that rapidly develop drug resistance due to transposition of a retrotransposon, Cnl1. Cnl1-mediated hypermutation is caused by a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding a novel RNAi component, Znf3, combined with a tremendous transposon burden. To elucidate adaptative mechanisms following RNAi loss, two bioinformatic pipelines were developed to identify RNAi loss-of-function mutations in a collection of 387 sequenced C. neoformans isolates. Remarkably, several RNAi-loss isolates were identified that are not hypermutators and have not accumulated transposons. To test if these RNAi loss-of-function mutations can cause hypermutation, the mutations were introduced into a non-hypermutator strain with a high transposon burden, which resulted in a hypermutator phenotype. To further investigate if RNAi-loss isolates can become hypermutators, in vitro passaging was performed. Although no hypermutators were found in two C. neoformans RNAi-loss strains after short-term passage, hypermutation was observed in a passaged C. deneoformans strain with increased transposon burden. Consistent with a two-step evolution, when an RNAi-loss isolate was crossed with an isolate containing a high Cnl1 burden, F1 hypermutator progeny inheriting a high transposon burden were identified. In addition to Cnl1 transpositions, insertions of a novel gigantic DNA transposon KDZ1 ([~]11 kb), contributed to hypermutation in the progeny. Our results suggest that RNAi loss is relatively common (7/387, [~]1.8%) and enables distinct evolutionary trajectories: hypermutation following transposon accumulation or survival without hypermutation.\n\nSignificance StatementThere is a dearth of antifungal drugs available to treat Cryptococcus neoformans, a human fungal pathogen of global impact. We previously identified natural hypermutators with a loss-of-function mutation in the RNAi machinery and transposon expansion. Here, we identified several novel natural isolates with RNAi defects, none of which are hypermutators or have undergone transposon expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these isolates can lie on a pathway to hypermutation following introduction of a transposon burden. In addition, a novel DNA transposon class was discovered that contributes to antifungal drug resistance. These findings highlight the importance of transposons in driving rapid adaptation in the absence of RNAi and reveal distinct evolutionary trajectories following RNAi loss, a relatively common event in C. neoformans.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.14.607850", "title": "The OMG dataset: An Open MetaGenomic corpus for mixed-modality genomic language modeling", "authors": "Cornman, A.; West-Roberts, J.; Camargo, A.

Aware actions demonstrated larger neurophysiological signals both preceding and following movement.

Bayesian neural networks offer a powerful strategy to build predictable models from sparse data, and inherently quantify both, aleatoric uncertainties of the data and epistemic uncertainties of the model. Yet, classical Bayesian neural networks ignore the fundamental laws of physics, they are non-interpretable, and their parameters have no physical meaning. Here we integrate concepts of Bayesian learning and constitutive neural networks to discover interpretable models, parameters, and uncertainties that best explain soft matter systems. Instead of training an individual constitutive neural network and learning point values of the network weights, we train an ensemble of networks and learn probability distributions of the weights, along with their means, standard deviations, and credible intervals. We use variational Bayesian inference and adopt an efficient backpropagation-compatible algorithm that approximates the true probability distributions by simpler distributions and minimizes their divergence through variational learning. When trained on synthetic data, our Bayesian constitutive neural network successfully rediscovers the initial model, even in the presence of noise, and robustly discovers uncertainties, even from incomplete data. When trained on real data from healthy and aneurysmal human arteries, our network discovers a model with more stretch stiffening, more anisotropy, and more uncertainty for diseased than for healthy arteries. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian constitutive neural networks can successfully discriminate between healthy and diseased arteries, robustly discover interpretable models and parameters for both, and efficiently quantify uncertainties in model discovery. We anticipate our approach to generalize to other soft biomedical systems for which real-world data are rare and inter-personal variations are large. Ultimately, our calculated uncertainties will help enhance model robustness, promote personalized predictions, enable informed decision-making, and build confidence in automated model discovery and simulation.\n\nOur source code, data, and examples are available at https://github.com/LivingMatterLab/CANN.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.20.608795", "title": "Analysis of the effects of mating systems on lineage diversification across multiple genera", "authors": "Xu, K.", "author_corresponding": "Kuangyi Xu", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Toronto", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "evolutionary biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.08.20.608795.source.xml", "abstract": "The transition from outcrossing to self-fertilization is a major evolutionary trend in plants, with selfing long hypothesized an evolutionary dead end.

We collected data on three mating-system-related characters. We also collected life form data to indirectly distinguish between mixed mating and highly selfing. We estimated speciation and extinction rates for character states, and state transition rates in 27 genera. We find that outcrossing lineages diversify at higher rates than selfing lineages, while the impact of mating systems on speciation is not consistent across genera. Among self-compatible lineages, annuals/short-lived exhibit significantly lower diversification rates than perennials. Models incorporating hidden states often provide a better fit than those without. The results suggest that selfing lineages overall have lower diversification rates. This may be primarily contributed by elevated extinction rates in highly selfing lineages, which may also explain the prevalence of mixed-mating systems.

International collaboration among numerous research groups yielded a substantial amount of experimental data, which greatly facilitated model validation and led to the development of new mathematical models. The aim of the study is an improvement of system understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the development of a modular mathematical model which provides a foundation for further research on host-pathogen interactions. We utilized the open-source BioUML platform to develop a model using ordinary, delay and stochastic differential equations. The model was validated using experimental data from middle-aged individuals with moderate COVID-19 progression, including measurements of viral load, antibodies, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and interleukin-6 levels. Parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis were conducted to refine the models accuracy. The model effectively reproduces moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 progressions, consistent with experimental observations. We investigated the efficiency and contributions of innate and adaptive immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed immune system behavior during co-infection with HIV and organ transplantation. Additionally, we studied therapy methods, such as interferon administration. The developed model can be employed as a framework for simulating other infectious diseases taking into account follow-up immune response.\n\nAuthor summaryDespite the significant progress reached in understanding of COVID-19, traditional methods still struggle to analyze and interpret the extensive and sometimes controversial experimental data on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mathematical and systems biology approaches attempt to address this challenge by developing mathematical models of the immune response. We aimed not only to investigate the disease at a systemic level but also to provide a framework for further research on host-pathogen interactions, both existing and forthcoming. To achieve this, we constructed a model incorporating both innate and adaptive immunity, as well as cellular and humoral components. This together allowed us to conduct a series of in silico experiments, exploring the immune response across various levels and compartments. The results of these investigations offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the immune system and can guide future research and therapeutic strategies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.20.608810", "title": "Plasma Membrane Remodelling in GM2 Gangliosidoses Drives Synaptic Dysfunction", "authors": "Nicholson, A.

Complex GSLs, containing sialic acid residues are known as gangliosides and are highly abundant in the brain. Diseases of ganglioside metabolism often result in severe, early-onset neurodegeneration. The ganglioside GM2 is the substrate of the hydrolytic lysosomal {beta}- hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme and when subunits of this enzyme are non-functional, GM2 lipid accumulates in cells leading to the GM2 gangliosidoses, Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. We have developed high-quality i3Neuron-based models of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, that demonstrate storage of GM2, formation of membrane whorls and accumulation of endolysosomal proteins consistent with disease phenotypes. Importantly, in addition to lysosomal dysfunction, the composition of the plasma membrane (PM) is significantly impacted in these diseases with changes in the abundance of both lipids and proteins. The changes to the PM proteome are driven in part by exocytosis of lysosomal material resulting in the aberrant accumulation of lysosomal proteins and lipids on the cell surface. The altered abundance of GM2 at the PM was striking, bringing the abundance of this precursor lipid up to that of the common neuronal gangliosides. Furthermore, the PM profiling identifies significant changes in synaptic protein abundances with direct functional impact on neuronal activity including rapid electrical firing consistent with neuronal hyperactivity. This work provides mechanistic insights into neuronal dysfunction in the GM2 gangliosidoses and highlights that these are also severe PM disorders.

Several high throughput experiments have demonstrated that despite its idiosyncrasy, epistatic effects exhibit global statistical patterns. Recently, Papkou et. al. constructed a fitness landscape for a 9-base region in the folA gene, which encodes for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in E. coli, and demonstrated that despite being highly rugged, the landscape is highly navigable. In this work, using the folA landscape, we ask two questions: (1) How does the nature of epistatic interactions change as a function of the genomic background? (2) How predictable is epistasis within a gene? Our results show that epistasis is \"fluid\" - the nature of epistasis exhibited by a pair of mutations is strongly contingent on the genetic background. Mutations exhibit one of two binary \"states\": a small fraction of mutations exhibit extremely strong patterns of global epistasis, while most do not. Despite these observations, we observe that the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of a genotype is highly predictable based on its fitness. These results offer a new perspective on how epistasis operates within a gene, and how it can be predicted.\n\nSignificance Statement.How a mutation changes organismal fitness is dependent on the genome in which it occurs. This phenomenon is known as epistasis and makes evolution unpredictable. Recent efforts to understand epistasis have led to the identification of statistical patterns in its manifestations. To study how epistasis operates in protein evolution, we analyze a recently reported landscape which quantifies fitness of [~]260000 sequences of an E. coli gene. We show two previously unknown properties of epistasis: \"fluid\" (epistasis between mutations is controlled via other epistatic interactions) and \"binary\" (only a few mutations exhibit statistical patterns; most do not). This work sheds new light on how epistasis manifests in gene sequences.

To resolve these inconsistencies, we 1) revisited pharmacological effects of the DA precursor L-DOPA on temporal discounting in a large sample of N = 76 healthy participants (n = 44 male) and 2) examined several putative proxy measures for DA to revisit the role of individual differences in a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled preregistered study (https://osf.io/a4k9j/). Replicating previous findings, higher rewards were discounted less (magnitude effect). Computational modelling using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation confirmed that the data in both drug conditions were best accounted for by a non-linear temporal discounting drift diffusion model. In line with recent animal and human work, L-DOPA reliably reduced the discount rate with a small effect size, challenging earlier findings in substantially smaller samples. We found no credible evidence for linear or quadratic effects of putative DA proxy measures on model parameters, calling into question the role of these measures in accounting for individual differences in DA drug effects.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.28.610030", "title": "Control of Physical and Biochemical Parameters Influencing Exogeneous Cargo Protein association to Extracellular Vesicle using Lipid Anchors Enables High Loading and Effective Intracellular Delivery", "authors": "Marquant, A.; Berthelot, J.; Bich, C.; Ibn Elfekih, Z.; Simon, L.; Robin, B.; Chopineau, J.; Tianpei Wang, D.; Jay Emerson, S.; Wang, A.; Benedetti, C.; Langlois, S.; Guglielmi, L.; Martineau, P.; Aubert-Pouessel, A.; Morille, M.", "author_corresponding": "Marie Morille", "author_corresponding_institution": "ICGM, Montpellier University, CNRS, ENSCM, Montpellier, France; Institut universitaire de France (IUF), Paris, France", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "bioengineering", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.08.28.610030.source.xml", "abstract": "Despite biomolecule delivery is a natural function of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), loading of exogenous macromolecules such as proteins into EVs remains a major challenge limiting their interest as convincing protein delivery systems for health applications. In this context, lipid-anchorage of exogenous cargo into EV membrane recently emerged as a promising option to enable their vectorization into cells. Nevertheless, this option was not explored for protein intracellular delivery, and further characterization of the critical parameters governing the association of a lipid-anchored cargo protein to EVs is still needed to confirm the relevance of this anchorage strategy. Therefore, in this work, we have sought to identify these parameters in a precise and quantitative manner, working with bulk and single nanoparticle analysis methods to identify protein loading capacity and subsequent intracellular delivery. Incubation temperature, cargo concentration and Lipid Anchor (LA) structure (lipid nature and PEG size) appeared as critical factors influencing maximal EV loading capacity. Precise control of these parameters enabled to load cargo protein close to EV saturation without hindering cellular delivery. Interestingly, we evidenced that EV isolation process influenced this association. Structural properties of LA influenced not only cargo protein/EV association, but also its intracellular delivery into different carcinoma cell lines. By thoroughly characterizing Lipid-PEG-protein anchorage, this study evidences the interest of this tunable and controllable approach for efficient EV protein delivery.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=61 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/610030v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16cd81dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e084c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2bf28borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140c256_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.08.29.607757", "title": "Structures of the cyanobacterial nitrogen regulators NtcA and PipX complexed to DNA fully clarify DNA binding by NtcA and recruitment of RNA polymerase by PipX", "authors": "Forcada-Nadal, A.; Bibak, S.; Salinas, P.; Contreras, A.; Rubio, V.; Llacer, J.

Characteristics of the types of solid tumors that may be the most receptive to this treatment approach remain unclear. In this work, we develop a spatiotemporal model for CAR T-cell treatment of solid tumors, and use numerical simulations to compare the effect of introducing CAR T cells via intratumoral injection versus intracavitary administration in diverse cancer types. We demonstrate that the model can recapitulate tumor and CAR T-cell data from imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models. Our results suggest that locally administered CAR T cells will be most successful against slowly proliferating, highly diffusive tumors, which have the lowest average tumor cell density. These findings affirm the clinical observation that CAR T cells will not perform equally across different types of solid tumors, and suggest that measuring tumor density may be helpful when considering the feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy and planning dosages for a particular patient.

Under stress conditions, growth is usually attenuated in favor of stress response, creating a trade-off between growth and stress. Autophagy is a vital process in eukaryotes, maintaining cellular balance by degrading and recycling cellular components. It is triggered by various nutrient-deprivation conditions and both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Surprisingly, over-expressing autophagy-related genes across multiple plant species resulted in increased plant size, yield, and stress resistance, posing autophagy as a regulator of the stress-growth balance. Yet, the molecular mechanisms governing its induction remain partially understood.\n\nIn the current work, we identified raffinose-a plant-derived sugar known for its role in stress responses-as a novel plant autophagy inducer. Raffinose treatment resulted in increased biomass and yield in an autophagy-dependent manner in several plant species. We also show that raffinose activates autophagy through the SnRK1 kinase complex, independent of TOR signaling, and that raffinose treatment results in increased expression of ATG5 and ATG7. We also point to possible downstream candidates operating autophagy-related biomass accumulation. Our findings offer new perspectives on the role of autophagy in maintaining a balance between plant growth and stress responses, underscoring the significance of raffinose in its regulation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe intricate balance between plant growth and stress responses is crucial for agricultural productivity, particularly as climate change intensifies environmental stressors such as drought and extreme temperatures. Usually, there is a trade-off between growth and stress response. Autophagy--a cellular recycling process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis--plays a pivotal role in this balance.

The SWI has proved difficult to explain via traditional Bayesian models, which predict the opposite effect: expected weight from size (smaller = lighter) should be integrated with felt weight, such that the smaller object should be perceptually lighter. Other authors have proposed that weight and density are combined according to Bayesian principles, or that Bayesian models incorporating efficient coding can predict the SWI via  likelihood repulsion. These models, however, have been evaluated only under the narrow conditions of typical SWI stimuli. Here we establish a general model of perceived weight for pairs of objects that differ in weight and / or density and / or size by varying amounts. In a visuo-haptic task, participants (N = 30) grasped and lifted pairs of cubes, and reported their perceived heaviness. We report that the SWI occurs even at very small density differences, repudiating the idea that the illusion requires a significant conflict between expected and felt weight. Across all object pairs, perceived weight was well explained by a model (R2 = .98) that includes a positive influence of both objects weights and the judged objects density, but a negative influence of the other objects density. Critically, the influence of both densities on perceived weight is strongly modulated by weight difference, being three times as large for zero / small weight differences than large differences. Thus, it is only under the unusual conditions of typical SWI studies that we confuse weight with density to a substantial extent. Unlike existing models, that are inconsistent with our more comprehensive dataset, our model provides a quantitative, accurate and generalised account of weight perception for pairs of objects across various weight and size conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryKnowing how heavy an object is allows us to grasp and lift it efficiently and without mishaps. Surprisingly, humans make systematic errors when judging the weight of objects of different size. For example, when two objects differ in size but have identical weight, the smaller object feels heavier. This is the  size-weight illusion. The illusion is strong and reliable and occurs even when we know that the two objects actually have the same weight. The size-weight illusion demonstrates that the human perceptual system doesnt work like a weighing scale, but instead takes into account other object features such as size or density, alongside weight. In this paper, we present a model that allows us to predict perceived weight in the size-weight illusion and across a wide range of objects of different weight / size / density, where previous models have failed.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.02.610804", "title": "A new Betaflexivirus species in Ferraria crispa plants", "authors": "Dekker, R.

In human synovial biopsies, CRTAM correlated with the expression of effector cytokines (IL21, IFNG), chemokine receptors (CXCR3, CXCR4, CCR5), granzymes (GZMA, GZMB, GZMK), and regulatory factors (TIGIT, EOMES, BATF) linked with T-cell-mediated immunity.

The hedgehog pathway plays an important role in wound healing, specifically in activating transcription factors that drive the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which in its intermediate state (partial EMT) is necessary for the collective movement of cells closing the wound. Herein, we propose a mechanism to explain HHIP's role in faulty epithelial wound healing, which could contribute to the development of emphysema, a key feature of COPD. Using two different Boolean models compiled from the literature, we show dysfunctional HHIP results in a lack of negative feedback on GLI, triggering a full EMT, where cells become mesenchymal and do not properly close the wound. We validate these Boolean models with experimental evidence gathered from published scientific literature. We also experimentally test if low HHIP expression is associated with EMT at the edge of wounds by using a scratch assay in a human lung epithelial cell line. Finally, we show evidence supporting our hypothesis in bulk and single cell RNA-Seq data from different COPD cohorts. Overall, our analyses suggest that aberrant wound healing due to dysfunctional HHIP, combined with chronic epithelial damage through cigarette smoke exposure, may be a primary cause of COPD-associated emphysema.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.09.612070", "title": "Calcium Binding Affinity in the Mutational Landscape of Troponin-C: Free Energy Calculation, Coevolution modeling and Machine Learning", "authors": "Pooja,  ; Bandyopadhyay, P.", "author_corresponding": "Pradipta Bandyopadhyay", "author_corresponding_institution": "School of Computational and integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru university, New Delhi", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.09.09.612070.source.xml", "abstract": "Mutation in calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) can significantly influence Ca2+ binding affinity (BA), resulting in substantial impairment in the signaling process and leading to several lethal diseases. The knowledge behind the changes in the binding affinity can help in understanding the signaling process and designing inhibitors for therapeutic usage. However, accurate prediction of BA for a large number of mutations has been elusive. In this work, for an important calcium binding protein, cardiac Troponin-C, we have developed an integrative modeling approach that combines molecular dynamics (MD)-based binding free energy calculations, prediction of plausible mutants using evolutionary information, and an interpretable machine learning model to predict Ca2+ BA for a large number of mutations (seventy-six in all). For the binding free energy calculation, we have used a charge-scaling based MD simulation that considers the polarization in the system, which is critical for divalent ion binding with proteins. The well-known molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method was used for the binding free energy calculations. The calculated results for twenty-four disease mutants, which are associated with different cardiomyopathies and have experimental binding affinity, are in close agreement with the experimental results. To study other plausible mutations, we have probed the evolutionary landscape of cardiac Troponin-C and used the EVmutation method of Hopf et al.(Nature biotechnology 2017, 35, 128-135) to generate sixty-one additional mutants. Finally, a Support vector regression model was developed for both observed and plausible mutations. Our machine learning model used simple structure and sequence-based descriptors along with MD-based descriptors and gave a mean squared error (MSE) of only 0.16 kcal/mol. Assessment of the contribution of each descriptor shows that the number of water molecules within the Ca2+ binding site, type of amino acid substitution (e.g. polar to hydrophobic reduces the binding affinity), and the distance of mutation with Ca2+ are the most important factors in determining the binding affinity. This integrative modeling can be used for other CBPs and can lay the path for modeling the complex and astronomically large mutational landscape of Calcium-binding proteins.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.09.612146", "title": "Distributional learning drives statistical suppression and deafening", "authors": "Luthra, S.; Luor, A.; Tierney, A.

The absolute and relative probability of an event influences a remarkable breadth of behaviors, from foraging for food to comprehending linguistic constructions -- even when these probabilities are learned implicitly. It is less clear how, and under what circumstances, statistical learning of simple probabilities might drive changes in perception and cognition. Here, across a series of 29 experiments, we probe listeners' sensitivity to task-irrelevant changes in the probability distribution of tones' acoustic frequency across tone-in-noise detection and tone duration decisions. We observe that the task-irrelevant frequency distribution influences the ability to detect a sound and the speed with which perceptual decisions are made. The shape of the probability distribution, its range, and a tone's relative position within that range impact observed patterns of suppression and enhancement of tone detection and decision making. Perceptual decisions are also modulated by a newly discovered perceptual bias, with lower frequencies in the distribution more often and more rapidly perceived as longer, and higher frequencies as shorter. Perception is sensitive to rapid distribution changes, but distributional learning from previous probability distributions also carries over. In fact, massed exposure to a single point along the dimension results in a sustained 'statistical deafening' along a range of subsequently encountered frequencies. This seemingly maladaptive loss of sensitivity - occurring entirely in the absence of feedback or reward - points to a gain mechanism that suppresses sensitivity to regions along a perceptual dimension that are less likely to be encountered.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.09.611397", "title": "Axolotl epigenetic clocks offer insights into the nature of negligible senescence", "authors": "Haluza, Y.; Zoller, J.

Although the neural underpinnings of the locus of this attentional spotlight have been relatively well studied, less is known about the size of the spotlight: to what extent can the attentional field be broadened and narrowed in accordance with behavioral demands? In this study, we developed a paradigm for dynamically estimating the locus and spread of covert spatial attention, inferred from visuocortical activity using fMRI in humans. We measured BOLD activity in response to an annulus while participants (4 female, 4 male) used covert visual attention to determine whether more numbers or letters were present in a cued region of the annulus. Importantly, the width of the cued area was systematically varied, calling for different sizes of the attentional spotlight. The deployment of attention was associated with an increase in BOLD activity in corresponding retinotopic regions of visual areas V1 - V3. By modeling the visuocortical attentional modulation, we could reliably recover the cued location, as well as a broadening of the attentional enhancement with wider attentional cues.

Mutualistic microbial symbionts can provide their hosts with protection from environmental stress that may contribute towards resilient responses to environmental change, however these changes may also disrupt species interactions and lead to declines in hosts and/or symbionts. Symbionts preserved within natural history specimens offer a unique opportunity to quantify changes in microbial symbiosis across broad temporal and spatial scales. We asked how the prevalence of seed-transmitted fungal symbionts of grasses (Epichloe endophytes) have changed over time in response to climate change, and how these changes vary across host species ranges. Specifically, we analyzed 2,346 herbarium specimens of three grass host species (Agrostis hyemalis,Agrostis perennans,Elymus virginicus) collected over the past two centuries (1824 - 2019) for the presence or absence of Epichloe symbiosis. We found that endophytes increased in prevalence over the last two centuries from ca. 25% prevalence to ca. 75% prevalence, on average, across three host species. Changes in seasonal climate drivers were associated with increasing endophyte prevalence. Notably, increasing precipitation during the peak growing season for Agrostis species and decreasing precipitation for E. virginicus were associated with increasing endophyte prevalence. Changes in the variability of precipitation and temperature during off-peak seasons were also important predictors of increasing endophyte prevalence. Our analysis performed favorably in an out-of-sample predictive test with contemporary survey data, a rare extra step in collections-based research. However, we identified greater local-scale variability in endophyte prevalence in contemporary data compared to model predictions based on historic data, suggesting new directions that could improve predictive accuracy.

Recently, hybrid architectures integrating both feedback and feedforward components have been shown to represent a viable alternative to fully feedback or feedforward controllers. Current literature on controller-based simulations, however, almost exclusively presents task-specific controllers that do not generalize across different tasks. The task-specificity of current controllers limits the generalizability of the neurophysiological principles behind such controllers.

We show that this controller can simulate physiological cycling patterns at different desired speeds. We also show that the controller can generalize to walking behaviors by just adding an additional control component for accounting balance needs.

Our understanding of how bone remodeling within cortical bone is controlled and altered with age in males and females is limited. Here, we generated bone marrow chimeric mice to understand the impacts of age and sex on bone remodeling. We demonstrate that transplantation of aged male or female bone marrow into young, lethally irradiated male hosts unexpectedly enhances cortical bone mass without impacting cancellous bone. Our single cell RNA-sequencing data show that mice reconstituted with aged bone marrow exhibited subsets of cells marked by CD11B/CD36 expression that demonstrate enhanced production of anabolic cytokines as compared to young counterparts, and that these myeloid subsets exist under conditions of normal physiology in aged mice. Importantly, CD11B+CD36+ cells do not differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro, and CD36 does not mark TRAP+ cells in vivo. Instead, CD36+ cells localize to resorption sites, including within cortical bone defects, suggesting their involvement in cortical bone remodeling and healing. CD11B+CD36+ cells also express elevated levels of bone anabolic WNT ligands, especially Wnt6. In functional assays, we demonstrate that soluble factors produced by CD11B+CD36+ cells enhance osteoblast progenitor commitment, mineralization, and activation of WNT signaling in vitro. Moreover, CD11B/CD36 exquisitely mark a subset of anabolic myeloid cells within human bone marrow.

We performed deep phenotyping of individual dopamine system function by combining multiple PET scans, fMRI, and dopaminergic drug administration in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects performed a rule-based response time task, with goal-directed and automatic decision-making operationalized as model-based and model-free influences on behavior.

In contrast, dopamine synthesis capacity was linked to the formation of model-based knowledge but not behavioral control. D2/3 receptors also modulated frontostriatal functional connectivity, suggesting they regulate behavioral control by gating prefrontal inputs to the striatum.

They undergo co-adaptation, allowing evolution to work on several genes to refine complex phenotypes, giving supergenes a competitive edge. Yet, due to their lack of recombination, supergenes are susceptible to deterioration as they cannot efficiently purge deleterious DNA. Few examples outside of sex chromosomes have been available for study. Here, we present the first assembly of the t haplotype, a 33.4 Mb supergene in house mice that 'selfishly' transmits itself at non-Mendelian frequencies. We characterize the four large non-overlapping inversions that make up the t haplotype. We compare in a t/t individual two different t variants with different recessive lethal phenotypes (age at death). Despite that difference, they differ much less from each other than the rest of the chromosome. However, the differences that they have were much more likely to be deleterious than the differences between the two variants of the rest of the chromosome. We interpret this marked difference as evidence of the accumulation of deleterious variants, a hallmark of deterioration. The t region of chromosome 17 is more distant to the reference than the rest of the chromosome, and has a higher fraction of impactful differences here as well. Thus, we conclude that the t appears as a quickly spreading and deteriorating selfish supergene, a rare example of Muller's ratchet outside of sex chromosomes.

To investigate this question, we used an in vivo optogenetic approach to reversibly manipulate actomyosin contractility at depth within the developing zebrafish neural rod. Contractility was induced along the lateral cortices of a small patch of developing neural epithelial progenitor cells, resulting in a shortening of these cells along their mediolateral axis. Imaging the immediate response of surrounding tissue uncovered a long-range, tangential, and elastic tissue deformation along the anterior-posterior axis. Unexpectedly, this was highly asymmetric, propagating in either the anterior or the posterior direction in response to local gradients in optogenetic activation. The degree of epithelialisation did not have a significant impact on the extent of force propagation via lateral cortices. We also uncovered a dynamic oscillatory expansion and contraction of the tissue along the anterior-posterior axis, with wavelength matching rhombomere length. Together, this study suggests dynamic and wave-like propagation of force between rhombomeres along the anterior-posterior axis.

We found that reduced miR-21 levels correlated with liver disease progression in WT mice fed on HFD, while miR-21 knockout mice showed exacerbated metabolic dysfunction, including obesity, hepatomegaly, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, steatosis, fibrosis, and HCC. Our study reveals that miR-21 plays a protective role in metabolic syndrome and in the progression of liver disease to cancer. MiR-21 directly targets Transforming growth factor beta-induced (Tgfbi), a gene also known to be significantly upregulated and a potential oncogene in HCC. Further, our study showed that intervention with the administration of a miR-21 mimic in WT livers effectively improves insulin sensitivity, steatosis, fibrosis, Tgfbi expression and tumor burden in HFD conditions.

PVH-specific deletion of Crh reduces anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Here we report that manipulation of PVH Crh expression in primary adrenal insufficiency or by dexamethasone (DEX) treatment do not alter mouse anxiety behaviors. In Experiment 1, we compared wildtype (WT) mice to those with primary adrenal insufficiency (MrapKO) or global deletion of Crh (CrhKO). We analyzed behaviors using open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), PVH Crh mRNA expression by spatial transcriptomics, and plasma ACTH and corticosterone after a 15-minute restraint test with ELISAs. EPM analysis showed CrhKO mice were less anxious than WT and MrapKO mice, and MrapKO mice had no distinguishing behavioral phenotype. In Experiment 2, we evaluated HPA axis habituation to chronically elevated Crh expression by comparing mice treated with 5-8 weeks of DEX with those similarly treated followed by DEX withdrawal for 1 week. All mice regardless of genotype and treatment showed no significant behavioral differences. Our findings suggest that reduced anxiety associated with low Crh expression requires extreme deficiency, perhaps outside of those PVH Crh neurons negatively regulated by glucocorticoids.

In contrast, when the E-I identities are sampled uniformly (not dependent on connectivity), the optimal E-I ratio falls around equal population size, and its overall achieved functional complexity is sub-optimal.

However, the success of metabarcoding is contingent on the quality of reference libraries, which are often incomplete or biased.

A list of species occurring in French freshwater ecosystems was established from official national checklists and Alpine lake surveys. The resulting library was analyzed for taxonomic completeness, barcode coverage and genetic diversity. The checklist consisted of 2,841 species across 10 phyla, for which 56% had at least one COI-5P sequences available in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD).

Perception of light quality via specialised photoreceptors signals the availability of sunlight for photosynthesis.

The balance of these wavelengths can determine the developmental strategy adopted by seedlings to either avoid shade, via stem elongation, or promote the expansion of photosynthetic organs. How seedlings regulate stomatal movements in different light environments is poorly understood. Using FR and UV-B supplementation to mimic aspects of canopy shade and sunlight respectively, we monitored stomatal apertures in Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledons. We show that low R:FR inhibits stomatal opening via a mechanism involving PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and increased abscisic acid (ABA). In contrast, UV-B perceived by the UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) photoreceptor antagonises this response to promote stomatal opening in a response requiring phototropin photoreceptors.

To address this, we had thirty young adults perform the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), during which their EEG and behavioural responses were recorded. States of sustained attention (in vs. out of the zone) throughout the task were identified based on the variance time course of participants reaction times. Out of the zone states were associated with increased errors of commission and reduced perceptual sensitivity compared to in the zone states, as expected. Importantly, a significant decline in theta oscillations at mid-prefrontal regions was found in out of the zone (vs. in the zone) states over a [~]400 ms period around the transition point between stimuli, and the extent of this decline predicted commission errors, RT variability, and response bias.

Finally, participants exhibiting greater theta variability showed a more pronounced decline in perceptual sensitivity when out of the zone and less stable RTs compared to those with lower variability.

We identify and characterise two distinct nonlinear phenomena: open-pore rectification and gating. Through extensive mutation analysis of aerolysin nanopores, we demonstrate that open-pore rectification is caused by ionic accumulation driven by the distribution of lumen charges. Additionally, we provide converging evidence suggesting that gating is controlled by electric fields pulling on lumen charges and controlled by local structural deformations.

The architecture comprises a simple model of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which sends controlling signals that manage the activity of internal models (IMs). The IMs organise synergies, coordinated and stereotyped activity of multiple muscles, in task-specific networks. The resultant organisations allow the generalisation of this architecture to different lower limb motions. The IMMC was tested in Stand-To-Walk simulations (STW), where the MLR switches between two IMs that recombine five synergies to replicate the standing and walking tasks. The simulation kinematics, muscle activation patterns and ground reaction forces were generally consistent with experimental data.

Here, we leverage high-resolution 7T functional MRI to test whether a bivalent retinotopic code structures activity within the human hippocampus and mediates hippocampal-cortical interactions. In seven densely-sampled individuals, we defined the retinotopic preferences of individual voxels within the hippocampus and cortex during a visual mapping task, as well as their functional connectivity during independent runs of resting-state fixation. Our findings reveal a robust retinotopic code in the hippocampus, characterized by stable population receptive fields (pRFs) with consistent preferred visual field locations across experimental runs. Notably, this retinotopic code is comprised of roughly equal proportions of positive and negative pRFs, aligning with the hypothesized role of negative pRFs in mnemonic processing. Finally, the signed amplitude of hippocampal pRFs predicts functional connectivity between retinotopic hippocampal and cortical voxels. Taken together, these results suggest that retinotopic coding may scaffold internal mnemonic and external sensory information processing within the hippocampus, and across hippocampal-cortical interactions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615433", "title": "Intrinsically disordered proteins can behave as different polymers across their conformational ensemble", "authors": "Chakraborty, S.; Morozova, T.

Here we define the pre- and post-synaptic organization of the spinal-projecting serotonergic system and define a role in locomotor control.

To gain further insight, we used FRG-NOD human liver-chimeric mice to conduct a P. falciparum genetic cross between QN-sensitive and QN-resistant parasites, which also differ in their susceptibility to chloroquine (CQ). By applying different selective conditions to progeny pools prior to cloning, we recovered 120 unique recombinant progeny. These progeny were subjected to drug profiling and QTL analyses with QN, CQ, and monodesethyl-CQ (md-CQ, the active metabolite of CQ), which revealed predominant peaks on chromosomes 7 and 12, consistent with a multifactorial mechanism of resistance. A shared chromosome 12 region mapped to resistance to all three antimalarials and was preferentially co-inherited with pfcrt. We identified an ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease (FtsH1) as one of the top candidates and observed using CRISPR/Cas9 SNP-edited lines that ftsh1 is a potential mediator of QN resistance and a modulator of md-CQ resistance. As expected, CQ and md-CQ resistance mapped to a chromosome 7 region harboring pfcrt. However, for QN, high-grade resistance mapped to a chromosome 7 peak centered 295kb downstream of pfcrt. We identified the drug/metabolite transporter 1 (DMT1) as the top candidate due to its structural similarity to PfCRT and proximity to the peak. Deleting DMT1 in QN-resistant Cam3.II parasites significantly sensitized the parasite to QN but not to the other drugs tested, suggesting that DMT1 mediates QN response specifically. We localized DMT1 to structures associated with vesicular trafficking, as well as the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, lipid bodies, and the digestive vacuole. We also observed that mutant DMT1 transports more QN than the wild-type isoform in vitro. Our study demonstrates that DMT1 is a novel marker of QN resistance and a new chromosome 12 locus associates with CQ and QN response, with ftsh1 is a potential candidate, suggesting these genes should be genotyped in surveillance and clinical settings.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.26.615244", "title": "Time-varying stimuli that prolong IKK activation promote nuclear remodeling and mechanistic switching of NF-\u03baB dynamics", "authors": "Smeal, S.

We employed a combination of genetic manipulations, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral assays in Drosophila to investigate the function of YL neurons and their molecular interactors in SELTM.

Our findings reveal that the YL neurons, expressing the Orb2 scaffolding protein, are indispensable for the formation of SELTM following sexual experience.

We demonstrate that sexual experience triggers synaptic plasticity in YL neurons, characterized by an increase in dendritic and presynaptic terminal areas, and a decrease in intracellular calcium levels. Furthermore, we show that YL neurons are specialized for the generation of appetitive sexual experience-dependent memory and project to brain regions implicated in memory formation. Our study uncovers the YL neurons as a key neural substrate for SELTM in Drosophila, shedding light on the molecular and circuit mechanisms that mediate the formation of long-term memories following sexual experience. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of taste-related memory and have broader implications for understanding the interplay between experience, memory formation, and behavior.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.26.615278", "title": "Microfluidic Modulation of Microvasculature in Microdissected Tumors", "authors": "Nguyen, T.

However, it has been challenging to control the generation and/or maintenance of microvasculature in ex vivo systems, a critical step for establishing cancer models of high clinical biomimicry. There have been great successes in engineering tissues incorporating microvasculature de novo (e.g., organoids and organs-on-chip), but these reconstituted tissues are formed with non-native cellular and molecular components that can skew certain outcomes such as drug efficacy. Microdissected tumors, on the other hand, show promise in preserving the TME, which is key for creating cancer models that can bridge the gap between bench and bedside. However, microdissected tumors are challenging to perfuse. Here, we developed a microfluidic platform that allows for perfusing the microvasculature of microdissected tumors. We demonstrate that, compared to diffusive transport, microfluidically perfused tissues feature larger and longer microvascular structures, with a better expression of CD31, a marker for endothelial cells, as analyzed by 3D imaging. This study also explores the effects of nitric oxide pathway-related drugs on endothelial cells, which are sensitive to shear stress and can activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase, producing nitric oxide.

The authors sincerely apologize to Ou et al. and the research community for the confusion. In this preprint, the authors performed an abdominal skin clearing experiment following the methods section in Ou et al. (ref. 1) and observed only a marginal clearing effect. In this condition (Figure 1), the authors detected tartrazine only in the stratum corneum (SC) of the skin, where only dead cells are present (Figure 1E, F). However, following a more detailed protocol with additional tips kindly provided by Ou et al. (ref. 1), the abdominal skin became more transparent. It seems that mechanical damage to the SC barrier is critical for successful clearing. In this condition, the authors detected strong tartrazine signals under the SC, including the dermis where live cells are located. We are still concerned about the issue of osmolality and toxicity to live cells; cleared cells must be under hypertonic conditions (Figure 3 and 4). However, since Figure 1 (especially Figure 1E, F) no longer stands, and the title can be misinterpreted as if the original results (ref. 1) were irreproducible, the authors believe it is best to withdraw this preprint.

However, long reads typically have higher error rates relative to short reads. If left unaddressed, subsequent genome assemblies may exhibit high base error rates that compromise the reliability of downstream analysis. Several specialized error correction tools for genome assemblies have since emerged, employing a range of algorithms and strategies to improve base quality. However, despite these efforts, many genome assembly workflows still produce regions with elevated error rates, such as gaps filled with unpolished or ambiguous bases. To address this, we introduce GoldPolish-Target, a modular targeted sequence polishing pipeline. Coupled with GoldPolish, a linear-time genome assembly algorithm, GoldPolish-Target isolates and polishes user-specified assembly loci, offering a resource-efficient means for polishing targeted regions of draft genomes.\n\nResultsExperiments using Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens datasets demonstrate that GoldPolish-Target can reduce insertion/deletion (indel) and mismatch errors by up to 49.2% and 53.4% respectively, achieving base accuracy values upwards of 99.9% (Phred score Q>30). This polishing accuracy is comparable to the current state-of-the-art, Medaka, while exhibiting up to 36-fold shorter run times and consuming 94% less memory, on average.\n\nConclusionGoldPolish-Target, in contrast to most other polishing tools, offers the ability to target specific regions of a genome assembly for polishing, providing a computationally light-weight and highly scalable solution for base error correction.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bcgsc/goldpolish", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615455", "title": "Identification of a novel basal body-localized epsilon-tubulin in Leishmania", "authors": "Seth, A.; Das, A.; Datta, R.", "author_corresponding": "Rupak Datta", "author_corresponding_institution": "Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "cell biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.09.27.615455.source.xml", "abstract": "Epsilon-tubulins are unconventional isoforms of the tubulin family, found in only a few organisms so far.

Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) has emerged as a critical immune-oncology target due to its overexpression in multiple cancers, where it enhances regulatory T cell (Treg) function and promotes tumour progression, often leading to a poor prognosis.\n\nThis study explored the effects of NRP1 inhibition in B16-F10 melanoma and its impact on peripheral Treg-mediated immune responses. NRP1 was overexpressed in several cancers, including B16-F10 cells, compared to non-tumorigenic NIH-3T3 cells. It inhibited NRP1 selectively induced apoptosis in B16-F10 cells without affecting NIH-3T3 cells. It also reversed the immunosuppression of splenic T cells induced by B16-F10-conditioned supernatants in vitro by reducing suppressor T cell markers (NRP1, NKG2A, FOXP3), Treg activity, and secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-17A). Additionally, NRP1 inhibition increased T cell proliferation and enhanced effector cytokine responses (TNF, IFN-{gamma}, IL-6, IL-2). NRP1 inhibition also downregulated the STAT, ERK MAPK, and Smad2/3 pathways while upregulating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In splenic T cells isolated from B16-F10 tumour-bearing mice treated with an NRP1 inhibitor, there was a reduction in immunosuppressive T cell marker expression and Treg suppressive activity, alongside an increase in T cell proliferation. NRP1 inhibitor treatment also significantly reduced lung metastasis, decreased tumour volume, and improved survival rates in these mice.\n\nThis study demonstrates that NRP1 inhibition may help reduce B16-F10 melanoma progression and associated peripheral Treg-mediated immunosuppression, highlighting its potential in developing future anti-cancer immunotherapy strategies, particularly in combination therapies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.27.615470", "title": "Predicting the Impact of Dialyzer Choice and Binder Dialysate Flow Rate on Bilirubin Removal", "authors": "Novokhodko, A.; Du, N.; Hao, S.; Wang, Z.; Shu, Z.; Ahmad, S.; Gao, D.", "author_corresponding": "Alexander Novokhodko", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Washington", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "2", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "bioengineering", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.09.27.615470.source.xml", "abstract": "Liver failure is the 12th leading cause of death worldwide.

We confirmed our models validity by predicting the impact of changing between two benchtop dialysis setups using different polysulfone dialyzers (F3 and F6HPS). We then applied it to predict the impact of varying dialysate flow rate on toxin removal. We found that bilirubin removal is independent of dialysate flow rate within the clinically relevant range (20 mL/min - 800 mL/min), matching our models predictions. At very low dialysate flow rates (2 mL/min), bilirubin removal declines, deviating from the thermodynamic model.

Recently, an alternative methodology for the relative dating of evolutionary events has been proposed that considers the distribution of branch lengths across sets of gene trees. Here, we validate this methodology using a fossil-calibrated phylogeny and propose a model-based formalisation using a Bayesian framework. Our analyses revealed that the normalisation of the compared branch lengths with branch lengths of a shared reference clade results in narrower distributions, allowing the correct inference of the relative ordering of evolutionary events. Moreover, we show that distributions of normalised lengths can be modelled using gamma or lognormal distributions.

We propose a structure learning approach to infer an agents internal model, composed of a learning rule and an internal representation of the environment. Crucially, the combined contribution of these components -- rather than their individual contribution -- determines the overall optimality of the agents behavior. By exploring various combinations of learning rules and environment representations, we identify the most probable agent model structure for each individual. We apply this framework to analyze rats learning behavior in a free-choice task within a T-maze with return arms, evaluating different internal models based on optimal and suboptimal learning rules, along with multiple possible representations of the T-maze decision graph. Identifying the most likely agent model structure based on the rats behavioral data reveals that slower learning rats employed either a suboptimal or a moderately optimal agent model, whereas fast learners employ an optimal agent model. Using the inferred agent models for each rat, we explore the qualitative differences in their individual learning processes. Policy entropy, derived from the inferred agent models, also highlights variations in the balance between exploration and exploitation strategies among the rats. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches to addressing suboptimal behavior focus separately on either suboptimal learning rules or flawed environment representations. Our approach jointly models these components, revealing that suboptimal decisions can arise from complex interactions between learning rules and environment representations within an agents internal model.

Experimental and theoretical work has argued both for and against the existence of specialization at the level of single neurons, where single neurons might be specialized to encode only particular subsets of variables among those represented by the whole brain region. Here, we use artificial neural networks to study the emergence of this local structure and work to reconcile experimental results that show local structure in some cases but not in others.

We show that both explicitly and implicitly modular solutions are abstract and allow for rapid learning and generalization on novel tasks as well as zero-shot transfer to novel stimuli. We further show that modular geometries facilitate the rapid learning of novel contexts that are related to previously seen contexts, while less structured geometries facilitate the rapid learning of novel unrelated contexts.

Subsequently, treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to directly activate the biallelic silenced Ube3a gene in mICD mice also resulted in efficient reinstatement of UBE3A, alongside a partial rescue of behavioral phenotypes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that UBE3A loss is the primary factor underlying AS phenotypes in the mICD/UPD mouse model, and also corroborate that UBE3A reinstatement is an attractive therapeutic strategy for mICD/UPD AS individuals.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615819", "title": "Hierarchy of prediction errors shapes the learning of context-dependent sensory representations", "authors": "Tsai, M.

PDAC cells also tend to cluster in regions with high, heterogeneous expression of the endothelial CD44 receptor. Simulations suggest that clustering results from the combination of CD44-mediated attachment and localized flow disturbances that facilitate subsequent cell attachment. Targeting CD44 using siRNA or function-blocking antibodies, or degrading its ligand hyaluronic acid (HA), almost completely abolishes PDAC cell attachment.

Interestingly, WNT activation also triggers an early contraction of stem cell colonies, with increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, resulting to cellular morphological changes. Small molecule inhibitors and genetic approaches were applied to determine if contractility is related to mesoderm differentiation. Contrary to expectation, suppressing contractility accelerated differentiation; Bra/T induction was enhanced, and EMT initiated as early as 24 hrs post WNT activation.

Our study demonstrates that centrosomes primarily inhibit congression initiation when CENP-E is inactive or absent by regulating the activity of kinetochore components. Depleting centrioles via Plk4 inhibition allows chromosomes near acentriolar poles to initiate congression independently of CENP-E. In contrast, at centriolar poles high Aurora A activity enhances Aurora B activity, increasing phosphorylation of microtubule-binding proteins at kinetochores and preventing stable microtubule attachments in the absence of CENP-E. Conversely, inhibiting Aurora A reduces Aurora B activity, enabling congression initiation even without CENP-E.

Consequently, both the basal and the cytokine-induced apoptosis of cultured MIN6 cells and dispersed human islets were inhibited. Overexpression of Otub2 in MIN6 cells increase the mRNA levels of NKx6.1 and Glut2 and concomitantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (by 2-3-fold). The beneficial effects of Otub2 on {beta}-cell function was demonstrated by the phenotype of Otub2-/+ and Otub2-/- mice, which manifested impaired glucose tolerance and increased expression of NFkB target genes (e.g. IP-10, MCP-1 and IL-1{beta}). RNAseq analysis of pancreata derived from OTUB2 KO mice revealed reduced expression of genes that down regulate K+ transporters (e.g. Ank2, Cacna1a and Kcnab1) combined with an increase in oxidative phosphorylation related genes. Given that closure of K+ channels is crucial for insulin secretion, these results could account, at least in part, for the impaired GSIS in the OTUB2 KO mice.

Previous reports have suggested that obesity-associated placental malperfusion may trigger a state of fetoplacental hypoxia, contributing to adverse health outcomes within and beyond the perinatal period. However, many previous studies have relied on indirect measures of tissue oxygen saturation, including readouts influenced by external inflammatory stressors. Direct comparisons of tissue oxygen saturation at the uteroplacental interface in pregnancies complicated by excess adiposity are lacking. Here, we used a mouse model of chronic preconception high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet feeding to model the impacts of an obesogenic milieu on placental oxygenation near term gestation (E17.5). We found that both placental junctional and labyrinth zone tissues were relatively hypoxic in HFHS pregnancies compared to chow-fed controls (CON). However, this was not associated with enhanced HIF-1 expression in labyrinth tissues. Similarly, placentas from CON and HFHS dams did not exhibit gross differences in morphology or vessel density and pericyte coverage. However, HFHS placentas have a greater burden of histopathological lesions, including tissue calcification and fibrinoid deposition within the labyrinth zone. Calcified placental tissue coincided with the destruction of vasculosyncytial membranes and macrophage-dense foci, alongside altered expression of immunomodulatory and chemotactic cytokines within the labyrinth zone proteome, which differed in magnitude with fetal sex. While fetal growth was not markedly affected, fetuses from HFHS pregnancies exhibited higher levels of circulating IL-6, prolactin, CXCL1, and CCL2. Collectively, these data confirm that diet-induced maternal excess adiposity leads to a relative state of placental hypoxia, even in the absence of marked growth restriction or fetal demise. While this hypoxic state is not linked to gross morphological abnormalities, it is associated with a greater histopathological burden indicative of local malperfusion and inflammation, and an altered fetal inflammatory and endocrine milieu in late gestation.

Interestingly, LVs that remained in the terminal-ileum draining lymphatic vessels were specifically dysfunctional, and tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) formed in this location. TLOs in the terminal ileum are associated with ileitis in humans and mice. However, mice lacking S1PR1 did not develop obvious characteristics of ileitis.

Some age-associated features like PVS were not consistently considered by the models, and the cerebellum was more important than expected. Taken together, we highlight the ability of end-to-end deep learning models combined with XAI to reveal biologically relevant, multi-feature relationships in the brain.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615795", "title": "The haplotype-resolved assembly of COL40 a cassava (Manihot esculenta) line with broad-spectrum resistance against viruses causing Cassava brown streak disease unveils a region of highly repeated elements on chromosome 12", "authors": "Thoben, C.; Pucker, B.; Winter, S.; Econopouly, B.

However, cassava production is threatened by several viral diseases, including cassava brown streak disease, which causes severe damage to the edible storage roots. Current cassava varieties in Africa lack effective resistance to this disease, leading to significant crop losses. We investigated the genetic diversity of cassava and identifed new sources of resistance to the viruses causing cassava brown streak disease. The cassava line, COL40, from a South American germplasm collection showed broad-spectrum resistance against all known strains of the viruses that cause this disease. To further understand the genetic basis of this resistance, we sequenced the genome of COL40 and produced a high-quality, haplotype-resolved genome assembly. This genomic resource provides new insights into cassavas genetic architecture, particularly in regions associated with disease resistance. The sequence reveals significant structural variation, including transposable elements, inversions, and deletions, which may contribute to the resistance phenotype. The reference genome assembly presented here will provide a valuable genomic resource for studying the cassava brown streak resistance and will help in accelerating breeding efforts to introduce virus resistance into African cassava varieties. By identifying genetic variants linked to resistance, future breeding programs can develop cassava cultivars that are more resilient to viral threats, enhancing food security and livelihoods for smallholder farmers across regions affected by the disease.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.29.615651", "title": "Novel AI-powered computational method using tensor decomposition can discover the common optimal bin sizes when integrating multiple Hi-C datasets", "authors": "Taguchi, Y.-h.; Turki, T.", "author_corresponding": "Y-h.

In plants, the physical cell wall-plasma membrane-microtubule continuum is proposed to be integral in transducing mechanical signals from the exterior to intracellular components [4-6]. Cortical microtubules (CMTs) rapidly reorient in response to mechanical stress to align with the maximal tensile stress direction [7,8].

Brain imaging studies suggest that these differences may be related to atypical brain responses to social-affective cues, affecting both the experience of receiving touch and observing it in others. However, it remains unclear whether these atypical responses are limited to specific brain regions or represent broader alterations in brain connectivity. The current study investigated how the functional network architecture is modulated during touch observation associated with autism and explored the extent to which changes in this architecture are associated with individual differences in social touch preferences and social responsiveness. By integrating generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis with independent component analysis (ICA), the current study analyzed existing fMRI datasets, in which 21 autistic and 21 non-autistic male adults viewed videos of social and nonsocial touch while undergoing MRI scans. A gPPI analysis of pre-defined regions of interest revealed that autistic adults exhibited increased connectivity between sensory and social brain regions. The strength of some of these connections was positively associated with a higher preference for social touch and greater social responsiveness, suggesting neural compensatory mechanisms that may help autistic adults better understand the meaning of touch. At the level of large-scale brain networks extracted using ICA, atypical connectivity was predominantly observed between the sensorimotor network and other networks involved in social-emotional processing. Increased connectivity was observed in the sensorimotor network during nonsocial touch, suggesting that embodied simulation, the process by which individuals internally simulate touch experience of others in this context, may be more engaged when observing human-object interactions than during human-to-human touch in autism. This study reveals atypical context-dependent modulation of functional brain architecture associated with autism during touch observation, suggesting that challenges in recognizing and using affective touch in social interactions may be associated with altered brain connectivity. Neural compensatory mechanisms in autistic individuals who enjoy social touch and show higher social responsiveness may function as adaptive social responses. However, these compensations appear to be limited to specific brain regions, rather than occurring at the level of large-scale brain networks.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615892", "title": "Multiple transcription factors regulate the expression of genes for error prone DNA polymerases in Acinetobacter baumannii", "authors": "Nguyen, B.

Currently, the DDR in A. baumannii is not well understood and the regulation of genes encoding multiple copies of DNA Pol V is not fully characterized. Through genome wide mutagenesis, we have identified a novel TetR-like family regulator of genes that encode DNA Pol V, which we have named Error-prone polymerase regulator, EppR. We have found that EppR represses the expression of the genes encoding DNA Pol V and itself through direct binding to a conserved EppR motif in their promoters.

These two gene products are functionally required to ensure regulation of expression of genes encoding DNA Pol Vs and umuDAb.

Discrete genomic changes and modulation in gene expression occur in Burkholderia pseudomallei undergoing adaptation. Alternatively, adapted colony morphotype variants of species belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) lose a complete replicon (the pC3 virulence megaplasmid), which affects their production of virulence factors. We report that variants arising in Burkholderia ambifaria clinical isolates - with affected phenotypes - have retained their pC3, suggesting that another phase variation mechanism can take place in this Bcc species. Proteomic and phenotypic characterisation showed that morphotype variants of B. ambifaria strains CEP0996 (pC3-null) and HSJ1 (pC3-positive) share similarities in phenotypes controlled by the Cep quorum sensing system. Thus, we determined the role of quorum sensing in B. ambifaria HSJ1 phase variation and confirmed that the main quorum sensing system Cep is important for the emergence of variants. As DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic factors involved in bacterial phase variation that regulates some virulence factors of the Bcc species Burkholderia cenocepacia, we hypothesized that B. ambifaria HSJ1 phase variation could also be regulated by adenosine DNA methylation. By deleting the three putative adenosine DNA methyltransferases, we found that an orphan type II DNA methyltransferase prevents the emergence of phase variants.

Our goal was to target an orphan G-Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) on platelets belonging to the olfactory receptor family as a new antithrombotic strategy.\n\nMethodsUsing an engineered reporter cell line expressing Olfactory Receptor 2L13 (OR2L13) that was recently identified as an orphan GPCR to limit platelet reactivity, we performed a high-throughput screen (HST) of non-odorant bioactive compounds with counter-screen validation, followed by studies to determine changes in platelet function in healthy subjects and in patients with coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. Phospho-proteomics identified key signal transduction pathways, and a variety of ex vivo assays and in vivo functional studies examined the impact of an identified non-odorant compound on platelet signaling, platelet biomechanics, and thrombosis.\n\nResultsWe identified 6 ligands specific for OR2L13 that function as receptor agonists, leading to the suppression of platelet aggregation and -granule exocytosis via P2Y12, PAR1, Thromboxane Receptor (TxR) and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptors, suggesting involvement of common downstream mediator. The lead OR2L13 agonist identified phosphorylates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and depolymerizes the platelet filamentous actin cytoskeleton which was further confirmed in a clot retraction assay (CCF0054500 clot area 70.6 vs. vehicle clot area 5.2, P<0.0001). This anti-thrombotic effect of the OR2L13 agonist was reversed by a HSP27 inhibitor (clot area 3.6, P<0.0001). In a murine cremaster arterial injury model, platelet accumulation at the injury site was reduced by 88.9% by the lead OR2L13 agonist compared to vehicle (P<0.0003) without altering fibrin generation in vivo, or interfering with the coagulation cascade, and without impairing the protective mechanism of platelet hemostasis.\n\nConclusionWe describe and characterize the first non-olfactory tool to target an olfactory receptor for the purpose of inhibiting platelet activation and thrombosis through downstream HSP27 in a comprehensive investigation using a first-of-its kind platelet inhibitor targeting an orphan platelet GPCR.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.28.615562", "title": "Seed specific overexpression of a modified wheat Or gene leads to enhanced \u03b2-carotene in rice and wheat grains", "authors": "Sirohi, P.; Vishnoi, R.; Baliyan, S.; Gupta, B.

Native membranes typically comprise different types of lipids, biomolecules and proteins assembled around a lipid bilayer structure. This complexity can render investigations challenging, with many studies relying on model membranes such as artificial vesicles and supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). The purpose of a model system is to capture the desired dominant features of the native context while remaining uniquely defined and simpler. Here, we search for a minimal lipid-only model system of the Escherichia coli inner membrane. We aim to retain the main lipidomic components in their native ratio while mimicking the membrane thermal and mechanical properties. We design a collection of candidate model systems reflecting the main aspects of the known native lipidomic composition and narrow down our selection based on the systems phase transition temperature. We further test our candidate model systems by independently measuring their elastic properties. We identify 3 ternary model systems able to form stable bilayers that closely mimic E. colis inner membrane lipid composition and mechanical properties. These model systems are made of commercially available synthetic 16:0-18:1 phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 16:0-18:1 phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and 16:0-18:1 Cardiolipin (CL).

Being a Gram-negative bacterium, E. Coli is characterized by a thin cell wall that separates two phospholipid membranes: the inner and outer membranes.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular pathology induced by the expression of R405W mutant desmin in murine skeletal muscle tissue.\n\nMethodsA comprehensive characterization of the skeletal muscle pathology in hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice was performed, employing grip strength, blood acylcarnitine and amino acid, histological, ultrastructural, immunofluorescence, immunoblot, ribosomal stalling, RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses.\n\nResultsBoth hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice showed classical myopathological features of a myofibrillar myopathy with desmin-positive protein aggregation, degenerative changes of the myofibrillar apparatus, increased autophagic build-up, and mitochondrial alterations. Muscle weakness and increased blood concentrations of acylcarnitines and amino acids were only present in homozygous animals. During its translation, mutant desmin does not induce terminal ribosomal stalling. Analyses of RNA sequencing and proteomic data from soleus muscle of 3-month-old mice depicted 59 up- and 2 down-regulated mRNAs and 101 up- and 18 down-regulated proteins that were shared between the heterozygous and homozygous genotypes in the respective omics datasets compared to the wild-type genotype. Combined analysis of the omics data demonstrated 187 significantly dysregulated candidates distributed across four groups of regulation. A down-regulation on the mRNA and protein levels was observed for a multitude of mitochondrial proteins including essential proton gradient-dependent carriers. Up-regulation on both omics levels was present for the transcription factor Mlf1, which is a binding partner of protein quality control related Dnajb6. Down-regulated on mRNA but up-regulated on the protein level was the sarcomeric lesion marker Xirp2 (xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 2), whereas Ces2c (acylcarnitine hydrolase) was regulated in the opposite way.\n\nConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that the expression of mutant desmin results in a myofibrillar myopathy in hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice. Combined morphological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses helped to decipher the complex pattern of early pathological changes induced by the expression of mutant desmin.

It is responsible for both the production of T cells and the prevention of their autoimmunity. It comprises two types of tissue: the cortex, where nascent T cells (thymocytes) are generated; and the medulla, embedded within the cortex, where autoreactive thymocytes are eliminated through negative selection. In mice, the medulla exhibits a complex, convoluted morphology, which has raised the question of whether its form impacts its function. Intriguingly, experiments also reveal a reverse dependency: the interactions between medullary stroma and thymocytes shape the medullary structure. However, understanding the underlying mechanisms of medulla morphogenesis emerging from these interactions remains elusive. Here, we present a conceptual theoretical model which shows that central, experimentally verified signaling pathways suffice to shape the convoluted medullary structure. The mathematical analysis of the model explains the observed effects of chemotaxis on thymocyte localization, as well as the reported morphological changes resulting from the modulation of thymocyte production. Our findings reveal that the established cross-talk between medulla growth and negative selection of thymocytes not only regulates medullary volume but also orchestrates the morphology of the thymus medulla. This mechanism of structure formation robustly organizes the medulla in a way that accelerates thymocyte negative selection by improving their chemotactic migration into the medulla. Thereby, we identify a feedback between the function of the thymus medulla and its form.

Each molecular subtypes displays distinct features resembling those of human HBs. However, research has been hampered by a paucity of established cell lines of any species.\n\nMethodsWe show here that immortalized cell lines can be routinely established from murine HBs that over-express B+Y and B+Y+N.

Human macrophages are important phagocytes engulfing and neutralizing pathogens and cell debris. In addition, they modulate the inflammatory process by releasing cytokines and lipid mediators. However, the link between oxylipins and phagocytosis in different macrophage phenotypes remains poorly understood.\n\nIn order to better understand the link between phagocytosis and the arachidonic acid (ARA) cascade, we established a phagocytosis assay in primary human  inflammatory M1- and  anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages from PBMCs, representing extremes of macrophage phenotypes. The branches of the ARA cascade were investigated by quantitative targeted proteomics and metabolomics.\n\nM1-like macrophages show a higher abundance of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and its products particularly after LPS stimulus compared to M2-like macrophages. LPS increased phagocytosis in M2-like, but not in M1-like macrophages. We demonstrate that the COX product PGE2 modulates the differential effects of LPS on phagocytosis: Via the EP4 receptor PGE2 signaling suppresses phagocytosis in primary human macrophages. Thus, blockage of COX, e.g. by NSAID, leads to an increase of phagocytosis also in  inflammatory M1-like macrophages and may shift the macrophages towards a more pro-resolving phenotype.

Intracellular trafficking regulates the availability of receptors on the cell surface to bind ligands, which regulate activation, and the movement of activated receptors between the surface and intracellular pools, where they can initiate different signaling pathways. Using experimental data and computational modeling, we recently demonstrated and quantified the differential trafficking of three VEGF receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and coreceptor Neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Here, we expand that approach to quantify how the binding of different VEGF ligands alters the trafficking of these VEGF receptors and demonstrate the consequences of receptor localization and ligand binding on the localization and dynamics of signal initiation complexes. We include simulations of four different splice isoforms of VEGF-A and PLGF, each of which binds to different combinations of the VEGF receptors, and we use new experimental data for two of these ligands to parameterize and validate our model. We show that VEGFR2 trafficking is altered in response to ligand binding, but that trafficking of VEGFR1 is not; we also show that the altered trafficking can be explained by a single mechanistic process, increased internalization of the VEGFR2 receptor when bound to ligand; other processes are unaffected. We further show that even though the canonical view of receptor tyrosine kinases is of activation on the cell surface, most of the ligand-receptor complexes for both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are intracellular. We also explore the competition between the receptors for ligand binding, the so-called  decoy effect, and show that while in vitro on the cell surface minimal such effect would be observed, inside the cell the effect can be substantial and may influence signaling. We term this location dependence the  reservoir effect as the size of the local ligand reservoir (large outside the cell, small inside the cell) plays an integral role in the receptor-receptor competition.

Due to the widespread pathological nature of AD, many brain regions are affected by amyloid beta plaques including regions important for vision such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus which is critical for relaying signals from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Using a wide range of techniques including electrophysiological approaches, in vivo and ex vivo imaging methods, and immunohistochemistry in a mouse model with progressing amyloidosis (5xFAD), the goal of this study was to determine whether AD-like pathology disrupts neuronal and synaptic structure and function in the visual system. In vivo electroretinogram recordings revealed photoreceptor dysfunction in the 6- and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice, while optical coherence tomography indicated no changes in retinal thickness. In the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the rodent homolog of the primate LGN, we identified decreased densities of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals and fewer thalamocortical (TC) neuron cell bodies. No detectable deficits in excitatory synaptic function or TC neuron dendritic structure were seen in the dLGN, and reflexive visual behavior was also found to be normal in the 5xFAD mice. These results indicate relatively modest amyloid-triggered dysfunction in these stages of the visual system suggesting that amyloid beta plaque formation may play only a small role in the visual system dysfunction seen in AD patients.

Our group has recently identified the polyphenol carnosic acid (CA), as a potent regulator of mast cell activation in the context of allergic inflammation. Due to the key role IL-33 plays in the enhancement of allergies and other mast cell-associated diseases, we sought to determine the inhibitory potential of CA in a model of IL-33-mediated mast cell activation. Bone marrow-derived mast cells were stimulated with IL-33 under potentiation of SCF and treated with CA in the presence or absence of an allergen co-stimulation. Here, it was determined that treatment with CA led to a reduction in early ROS production, which translated into a significant impairment in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-13, TNF and chemokines CCL1, CCL2 and CCL3. Surprisingly however, it was determined that CA treatment increased signaling through Akt and NF{kappa}B protein phosphorylation, leading to increased gene expression of IL6, IL13, and CCL3 as well as increased intracellular concentrations of IL-6 and CCL3.

Here, we address these questions in ant colonies, considered superorganisms. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis applied to eusocial organisms predicts that colonies experiencing food shortage should reduce investment in costly individuals. In polymorphic colonies, the largest workers known as \"majors\" are costly to produce and should therefore be less abundant in colonies experiencing food shortage. Alternatively, the starvation resistance hypothesis posits that colonies in stressful environments should maintain larger colonies, which provide a nutritional buffer in times of food shortage. We show that the proportion of majors in colonies of the Hercules ant, Camponotus herculeanus, decreases plastically with increasing latitude across the temperate and boreal forest biomes of eastern Canada, independently of their average body size, or colony size, resulting in a thrifty superorganism phenotype. Furthermore, we find that the low number of days, annually, when workers can nurse the brood, best predicts these phenotypes.

Although CTCs contribute to the metastatic cascade, and diverse phenotypes of CTCs have been observed - including the cytokeratin expressing CTCs, CTC clusters, large polyploid CTCs, and CTCs undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition - little is known about their functionality. By virtue of CTCs being rare, a detection method that maximizes the information obtained per cell would be ideal to understand their biology and for use in diagnostic approaches. The challenge is that rare cell detection necessitates extensive processing steps, during which molecular content, such as RNA and DNA, needs to be preserved for downstream single cell analysis. We developed GEnomic, Transcriptomic, and MOrphological profiling of Rare cells (GeTMoR), a method that extends the High Definition Single Cell Assay for detecting rare cancer related cells to simultaneously image and profile the genome and transcriptome from single rare cells. We validated GeTMoR by spiking in cancer cell lines into whole blood to evaluate the quality of recovered gene expression and copy number profile from the same cell.

Studies using animal models have shown that binge eating animals consume food in quantities that surpass physiological necessity, and that the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior overlap with those involved in habit formation. Habitual behaviors are thought to be automatic responses acquired through extended behavioral training and are dependent on the context in which they were learned. Therefore, this study hypothesized that binge eating has a context-dependent component. We investigated whether the excessive palatable sugar intake observed in an animal model of binge eating is triggered by an associated context as a learned behavior. To test this, mice were trained to develop binge-like sugar consumption in a specific context. During the test phase, we reduced the animals hedonic needs for sugar solution by providing a two-hour satiety period. Sugar solution was then presented in both the training context and a novel context. The results showed that in the training context, the mice continued to consume sugar solution at levels similar to those observed at the onset of the satiation. In contrast, this context-induced sugar consumption was not observed in the novel context.

In this study, we employed EIS to detect EMT in prostate cancer cells (PCCs). PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells were treated with an EMT induction media for five days. EIS characterization revealed unique impedance spectra correlating with metastatic potential, distinguishing DU145 EMT+ and EMT-cells, and LNCaP EMT+ and EMT-cells (in combination with dielectrophoresis), with comparisons made to epithelial and mesenchymal controls. These changes were supported by shifts in electrical signatures, morphological, and protein expression, including downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin. No phenotype change was observed in PC3 cells, which maintained a mesenchymal phenotype. EMT+ cells were also distinguishable from mixtures of EMT+ and EMT-cells. This study demonstrates key advancements: application of EIS and dielectrophoresis for label-free EMT detection in PCCs, characterization of cell electrical signature after EMT, and EIS sensitivity to EMT transitions.

It is challenging to use this information for analysis of distribution and trends. The lack of a protocol leads to bias in observations and therefore data are not representative. The bias is a consequence of unequal detection probabilities, caused by different preferences and habits of citizen scientists.\n\nMETHODSWe propose to incorporate characteristics of these excursions in analyses of data collected by citizen scientists to improve estimates of the probability that a species is not detected and reported, even though it does occur. By limiting these models to areas that are known to be occupied, detection can be modeled separately without considering variation in occupancy. We apply this idea to 150 common species in the Southwest Delta of The Netherlands, and illustrate the data selection, the modeling process and the results using four species.\n\nRESULTSThe strongest features to predict detection are the number of species during a visit (list length), earlier observations of the target species by the same observer, and the day of year. We compare three approaches to predict the total non-detection probability that takes all visits to an area into account. Predictions based on only the number of visits were outperformed by predictions that also take the list length into account. Our predictions based on all features combined consistently beat both other approaches, across all 10 species groups that were compared.\n\nDISCUSSIONWe thus show that explicitly modelling the characteristics of all visits to an occupied area results in estimation of non-detection probabilities, while providing insight into the causes of detection and reporting bias. Furthermore, predictions of our model provide a basis for quantifying the sampling effort in each area, which is a promising first step to correct bias in citizen science data when aiming to map a species distribution.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615750", "title": "Unlocking the Potential of Low Quality Total RNA-seq Data: A Stepwise Mapping Approach for Improved Quantitative Analyses", "authors": "Lee, J.; Gim, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jungsoo Gim", "author_corresponding_institution": "Chosun University", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "bioinformatics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.09.30.615750.source.xml", "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing assays face persistent challenges when analyzing low-quality RNAs, often assessed by the RNA integrity number (RIN).

The EH domains contribute towards the establishment of a complex interaction network within clathrin mediated endocytosis by interacting with Asp-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs within intrinsically disordered regions of other endocytic proteins. Using NMR spectroscopy, we investigate the molecular origins of binding from the side of the EH domains as well as from the side of the most intrinsically disordered region of the partner Dab2. In addition to NPF binding, we detect a high level of binding promiscuity leading to significant interaction with non-NPF binding sites. This behavior also leads to interactions between Eps15s EH domains and its own IDR. When all EH domains are expressed in row, as they occur in the wild type full length protein (EH123), EH2 and EH3 tumble together as one entity, while EH1 moves independently. The full EH-domain, comprising EH1, EH2 and EH3, interacts with both Dab2 and Eps15s IDR at the same time with partially competitive binding sites. These data allow insights into competitive network-like interactions determining the early phases of clathrin mediated endocytosis.\n\nSignificance StatementMulti-domain proteins are frequent in many biological processes. Rather than just acting like beads on a string, the EH domains of Eps15 engage in interactions, leading to complex and competitive binding with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) involved in Eps15 itself as well as of other endocytic proteins. Such interactions are important to understand how the early phases of clathrin mediated endocytosis are regulated and offer ideas for how interactions may take place in other multi-domain/IDR protein systems.

Factors such as maternal age, sexually transmitted infections, and genetic abnormalities are notably implicated. Globally, there has been minimal improvement in preterm birth rates, leading to substantial economic losses and underscoring the need for innovative approaches.\n\nObjectiveThis study aims to analyze and detect uterine contractions by applying deep learning techniques to physiological data derived from maternal electrocardiograms (ECGs). Leveraging ECGs, which are easily obtainable from wearable devices, allows for effective and convenient monitoring of uterine contractions outside clinical settings. Since uterine contractions are a critical indicator for assessing the risk of preterm birth, our algorithm has the potential to facilitate early identification of high-risk individuals, thereby contributing to timely interventions and improved maternal-fetal outcomes.\n\nMethodsParticipants meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were recruited from patients admitted to or attending outpatient services at Saintpaulia Misao Ladies Hospital in Gifu, Japan, between December 6, 2023, and July 31, 2024. Our deep learning model was developed using maternal ECG data, uterine contraction waveforms obtained from cardiotocograms (CTGs). The collected data were divided into training and evaluation datasets. The AI-generated uterine contraction waveforms from the developed model were compared with ground truth labels obtained from the fetal monitoring devices. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine at Gifu University and was conducted as a collaborative research effort with nonat Inc. (the lead research institution) and Saintpaulia Misao Ladies Hospital (joint research institution).\n\nResultsFinally, 73 participants took part in this study, and 57 datasets were used for algorithm development and evaluation. Multiple measurements were taken on the same subjects on different days only with their consent. Our analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between the uterine contraction waveforms estimated by the developed model and the ground truth waveforms from CTGs, achieving an average correlation across all evaluation data (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.53).\n\nConclusionThis is the worlds first trial to detect uterine contractions from maternal ECGs using deep learning algorithms. In this study, we successfully developed a deep learning algorithm capable of accurately inferring uterine contraction waveforms from maternal ECGs. Given that ECGs can be easily obtained using wearable devices, this approach may provide healthcare professionals with objective and precise information on uterine contractions--a crucial indicator of preterm labor--even in resource-limited settings outside hospital environments.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616050", "title": "BMP signaling modulations control primitive streak patterning", "authors": "Simon, G.; Plouhinec, J.-L.; Gilardi-Hebenstreit, P.; Sorre, B.; Collignon, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jerome Collignon", "author_corresponding_institution": "Universite Paris Cite, CNRS, Institut Jacques Monod", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "developmental biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.10.01.616050.source.xml", "abstract": "The primitive streak (PS) is the embryonic structure from which mesoderm and definitive endoderm cells emerge to form organs and fetal tissues. The identities of the cells leaving the PS depend on both the time and the position at which they exit.

Using 2D gastruloids that recapitulate early aspects of mouse gastrulation in vitro, we have previously shown that WNT3 and NODAL promote distal PS fates on their own, and proximal PS fates in the presence of BMP4. We now detail further the impact of BMP4 on the cell identities produced in gastruloids. Single cell RNA-seq analysis shows that prolonged exposure to BMP4 results in the presence of all the cell types, including primordial germ cells, which normally form from the most proximal part of the pluripotent epiblast. We then show that reducing the duration or intensity of gastruloid exposure to BMP4 can allow the emergence of more distal cell identities, such as paraxial mesoderm, alongside anterior PS derivatives.

In passerine birds, sperm exhibit considerable variation in size, yet the basic sperm phenotype is highly conserved; sperm are filiform, the head is corkscrew-shaped, and the midpiece is elongated and twisted around the flagellum. A significant departure from this typical sperm morphology has been reported in the sister species, the Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and Azores bullfinch (P. murina). Here, we report a second evolutionary shift in passerine sperm phenotype in the nominate subspecies of the red-browed finch (Neochmia temporalis temporalis); sperm are non-filiform, with an ellipsoid head, and an extremely short midpiece restricted to the nuclear-axoneme junction. Additionally, we show that the sperm phenotype of the red-browed finch is similar to the putatively neotenous sperm described in the two bullfinch species. Using whole-genome data, we found no evidence that the unusual sperm phenotype of the red-browed finch is associated with reduced genetic variation or a population bottleneck. In contrast, we find some support for the hypothesis that relaxed post-copulatory sexual selection may, at least in part, explain the unusual sperm of the red-browed finch. We also discuss the possible roles of mutation, genetic drift, and genetic hitchhiking, in the evolutionary origins and maintenance of neotenous sperm phenotypes.

Thrombocytosis has been well documented in patients affected with IDA. Thus, significance of eRBC parameters in identifying iron deficiency associated thrombocytosis was also examined in this cohort.\n\nMethodsBlood samples were collected in EDTA tubes from consenting donors for analyses of routine haematological and eRBC parameters. Serum samples were isolated for estimation of iron parameters.\n\nResultsIron deficient donors had significantly altered eRBC parameters. Among them, Ret-He with a cut-off of [&ge;]32 pg had high AUC (0.822) and showed relatively high sensitivity & specificity in detecting iron deficiency. Combination of Ret-He with CCI increased sensitivity & specificity to 90.6% and 98.2%, in detection of donors affected with iron restricted erythropoiesis. This cohort had increased platelet counts, which showed significant association with Ret-He ({beta}= -0.373), RBC-He ({beta}= -0.384), CCI ({beta}= 0.384), Hypo-He ({beta}=0.494) and Micro-R ({beta}= 0.299).

Previous reports have investigated the importance of these parameters in identifying IDA in blood donors. The present study is the first one which indicates combining different eRBC parameters such as Ret-He and CCI increases their accuracy of detection.

In patient-derived GBM cell lines, we found that cells from different GBM express different lamin levels. Nuclear size correlates positively with the ratio between lamin A and lamin B1 while nuclear stiffness increases with the levels of both lamin A and lamin B1. A simple mechanical model suggests that lamin A and lamin B1 act like springs in series. We also show that cells proliferate faster in GBM cell lines expressing higher lamin A levels. Downregulating lamin A expression in these cells reverse the aggressive phenotype. In contrast with breast cancer cells for which reduced lamin A levels favor cell migration in a confined environment, increased levels of lamin A may facilitate the invasion of more aggressive GBM cell lines in the soft environment of the brain.

However, due to the high computational cost of MD simulations, it is still challenging to explore a wide conformational space. To solve this problem, a variety of accelerated MD schemes have been proposed over the past few decades. The bond-boost method (BBM) is one of such accelerated MD schemes, which expedites escape events from energy basins by adding a bias potential based on changes in bond length. In this paper, we present a new methodology based on the BBM for accelerating the conformational transition of proteins. In our modified BBM, the bias potential is constructed using the dihedral angle and hydrogen bond, which are more suitable variables to monitor the conformational change in proteins. Additionally, we have developed an efficient algorithm compatible with the LAMMPS package. The method is validated with the conformational change of Adenylate kinase (AdK) by comparing the conventional and accelerated MD simulation results. Based on the accelerated MD results, the characteristics of AdK are investigated by monitoring the conformational transition pathways and the behavior of interdomain salt bridges. Moreover, the free energy landscape calculated using umbrella sampling confirms all the states identified by the accelerated MD simulation are the free energy minima and the system makes transitions following the path indicated by the free energy landscape.

Here, we address the spatial organisation and functional role of ECM components in the megakaryocyte vascular niche. We reveal that laminin and collagen IV form three-dimensional (3D) cage of ECM connected to the sinusoidal basement membrane that surrounds the individual megakaryocytes. The 3D cages of ECM are controlled by megakaryocytes since megakaryocyte-specific {beta}1/{beta}3 integrin knockout (Itgb1-/-/Itgb3-/-) is characterised by weakened ECM cages. This is associated with an increased megakaryocyte intravasation and the passage of entire megakaryocytes into the circulation.

In addition, we quantitatively characterized the neuronal responses to food and pheromone inputs by measuring calcium traces from ASI and AIA neurons. We found that calcium in ASI increases linearly in response to food, and similarly decreases in response to pheromone, revealing a cellular site of antagonism between these key chemical inputs. Notably, the ASI response persists well beyond removal of the food stimulus, thus encoding a memory of recent food exposure. In contrast, AIA reports instantaneous food availability, and is unaffected by pheromone. We discuss how these findings may inform our understanding of this long-term decision-making process.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.614977", "title": "Introducing Haptic Feedback in Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback: A Novel Approach to Modulate Primary Motor Cortex Activity", "authors": "Fleury, M.; Cloerec, P.; Duche, Q.; Lioi, G.; Lecuyer, A.", "author_corresponding": "Mathis Fleury", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institut Pasteur", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "bioengineering", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.09.30.614977.source.xml", "abstract": "As fMRI-Neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) is still in its early stages, many questions remain regarding the optimal methodology, particularly in relation to feedback modalities.

However, most fMRI-NF protocols to date have primarily used visual feedback, which may not be ideal in all cases. Certain individuals or populations might benefit from alternative or additional feedback modalities, such as haptic feedback --a novel approach in this field-- along with auditory, virtual reality/immersive environments, or a combination of these. In this study, we assess the performance of neurofeedback elicited by a motor imagery (MI) task using visuo-haptic feedback and compare it to unisensory visual and haptic feedback.

Two drugs may show a synergistic effect but may sometimes cause a severe health issue, including lethality.

Specifically, the phantom-based matching resolution approach assumes that scanned phantom PET images are well approximated by a ground truth, noise-free digital phantom convolved with a Gaussian kernel of unknown size. The size of the kernel is then estimated by an exhaustive search on the amount of blurring needed to match the smoothed digital phantom to a particular scanned phantom image. Unfortunately, Hoffman phantom images may not always be readily available, and phantom-based approaches may yield sub-optimal results. We propose a new, computational approach that allows estimation of spatial resolution directly from the PET image itself. We generalized the so-called logarithmic intensity plots method to the 3D case to perform a spatial resolution estimation in both axial and in-plane directions of the PET images. The proposed approach was applied to two different cohorts. The first cohort consisted of [18F]florbetapir amyloid PET images and matching phantoms coming from a Phase II clinical trial and includes different scanner models and/or orientation and grid reconstructions. The second cohort included {beta}-amyloid, FDG and tau PET images from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We obtained in-plane and axial resolution estimators that vary between 3.5 mm and 8.5 mm for both PET and matching phantom images. In both cases, we obtained small across-subject variability in groups of images sharing the same PET scanner model and reconstruction parameters. For human PET images, we also obtained a strong cross-tracer and longitudinal consistency in the spatial resolution estimators. Our novel approach does not only eliminate the need for surrogate brain phantom data, but also provides a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of tracers and other image modalities, such as SPECT.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615704", "title": "Linking microscopy to diffusion MRI with degenerate biophysical models: an application of the Bayesian EstimatioN of CHange (BENCH) framework", "authors": "Kor, D.

To understand the biological underpinning of some observed change in MR signal between different conditions, BENCH predicts which model parameter, or combination of parameters, best explains the observed change, without having to invert the model. BENCH has been previously used to identify which biophysical parameters could explain group-wise dMRI signal differences (e.g. patients vs. controls); here, we adapt BENCH to interpret dMRI signal changes related to continuous variables. We investigate how parameters from the dMRI standard model of white matter, with an additional sphere compartment to represent glial cell bodies, relate to tissue microstructure quantified from histology. We validate BENCH using synthetic dMRI data from numerical simulations. We then apply it to ex-vivo macaque brain data with dMRI and microscopy metrics of glial density, axonal density, and axonal dispersion in the same brain. We found that (i) increases in myelin density are primarily associated with an increased intra-axonal volume fraction and (ii) changes in the orientation dispersion derived from myelin microscopy are linked to variations in the orientation dispersion index.

Oddball stimuli embedded in a sequence of regularly repeated visual elements have been shown to drive relatively large deviant responses, a finding that is generally consistent with the theory that cortical circuits implement a form of predictive coding. These results can be confounded by short-term adaptation effects, however, that make interpretation difficult. Here we use various forms of the oddball paradigm to disentangle temporal and ordinal components of the deviant response, showing that it is a complex phenomenon affected by temporal structure, ordinal expectation, and event frequency. Specifically, we use visually evoked potentials to show that deviant responses occur over a large range of time, lead to long-term plasticity in some cases, cannot be explained by a simple adaptation model, scale with predictability, and are modulated by violations of both first and second-order sequential expectations.\n\nSignificance StatementVisual experience and temporal context can modulate evoked responses in mouse V1. There remains disagreement about whether this reflects predictive coding in visual circuits and if visual mismatched negativity, which has important cross-over implications for human clinical work, constitutes evidence supporting this theory or simple neural adaptation. This work strongly supports the former interpretation by demonstrating complex experience-dependent deviant responses that cannot be easily explained by a simple adaptation model.

A novel mutation adds new alleles, hence is tantamount to a change of the game by the addition of new actions.

To address this, we compare evolutionary signatures extracted from CG methylomes and genomes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon. While methylation variants (SMPs) are less effective than genetic variants (SNPs) for identifying population differentiation in A. thaliana, they can classify phenotypically divergent B. distachyon subgroups that are otherwise genetically identical. The site frequency spectra generated using methylation sites from varied genomic locations and evolutionary conservation exhibit similar shapes indicating minimal noise when jointly analyzing all CG sites. Nucleotide diversity is three orders of magnitude higher for methylation variants compared to genetic variants in both species, driven by the higher epimutation rate. Correlations between SNPs and SMPs in nucleotide diversity and allele frequencies at gene exons are weak or absent in A. thaliana, possibly because the two sources of variation reflect evolutionary forces acting at different timescales. Linkage disequilibrium quickly decays within 250bp for methylation variants in both plant species suggesting their versatility for evolutionary analyses. Finally, we developed a deep learning-based demographic inference approach and identified recent population expansions in A. thaliana and B. distachyon using methylation variants that were not identified when using genetic variants.

A key advantage of these methods is the potential to detect association signals caused by allelic heterogeneity -- when multiple causal variants modulate a phenotype -- in both coding and noncoding regions. Recent scalable methods for inferring locus-specific genealogical trees along the genome, or representations thereof, have made substantial progress towards this goal; however, the problem of testing these trees for association with phenotypes has remained unsolved due to the growth in the number of clades with increasing sample size. To address this issue, we introduce several practical improvements to the kalis ancestry inference engine, including a general optimal checkpointing algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models, thereby enabling efficient genome-wide analyses. We then propose  LOCATER, a powerful new procedure based on the recently proposed Stable Distillation framework, to test local tree representations for trait association. Although LOCATER is demonstrated here in conjunction with kalis, it may be used for testing output from any ancestry inference engine, regardless of whether such engines return discrete tree structures, relatedness matrices, or some combination of the two at each locus. Using simulated quantitative phenotypes, our results indicate that LOCATER achieves substantial power gains over traditional single marker testing and window-based testing in cases of allelic heterogeneity, while also improving causal region localization relative to single marker tests. These findings suggest that genealogy based association testing will be a fruitful approach for gene discovery, especially for signals driven by multiple ultra-rare variants.\n\nAuthor summaryFor a given set of individuals and at particular location in the genome, there is an underlying genealogical tree relating those individuals. Due to recombination, this tree is not static but rather varies along the genome. For decades investigators have sought to learn and use these trees to identify regions of the genome that impact human traits and disease. In other words, to find trait-associated trees where different clusters of relatives have, for example, high blood pressure. However, since these trees can be so enormous, it is difficult computationally to build them from DNA samples and difficult statistically to find trees with disease clusters: since each tree encodes so many possible clusters, it becomes hard to distinguish signal from noise. Here, we develop a new statistical method, LOCATER, to efficiently aggregate signals across disease clusters within each tree and thereby detect trait-associated trees. LOCATER can work with any ancestry inference method. We show LOCATER is better at detecting these trees than existing methods. We also introduce a suite of broadly applicable algorithms that make our ancestry inference software, kalis, and LOCATER computationally efficient.

POWV remains an under-studied pathogen, despite the potential for serious and life-threatening neurologic complications following infection. While prior studies have characterized viral diversity due to single nucleotide polymorphisms, little is known about POWV recombination, defective RNAs (D-RNAs), and functional structural variants (SVs). Understanding POWV recombination in its natural vector can provide important insights into its replication and evolution. Thus, we analyzed POWV sequence data from 51 ticks collected from the Northeast United States to characterize deletion expression levels and patterns in naturally infected ticks, and we compared these results to single-passage isolates. We found that deletions were common in POWV RNA from ticks and that several areas of the genome were enriched for recombination junctions. Deletions were often associated with areas of microhomology. While most deletions were sample-specific, two major deletion archetypes were observed across multiple tick samples. The first consisted of small 19-50 base deletions in the methyltransferase domain of the ns5 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene, resulting in a mixture of putative SVs and D-RNAs. The second consisted of approximately 1600 base deletions spanning the ns2a-ns3 genes, resulting in putative D-RNAs with abrogated viral protease function. Protease deletions were significantly enriched after one passage in baby hamster kidney cells despite a decrease in overall deletion expression. These results demonstrate the proclivity of POWV for recombination, with potential implications for immune evasion and persistence in ticks.\n\nIMPORTANCEPowassan virus is a tick-borne flavivirus that can cause serious, life-threatening neurological disease. Understanding how Powassan virus replicates and evolves within its tick vector may elucidate factors important in persistence, transmission, and human disease. Defective RNAs are replication-incompetent viral genomes generated through internal deletions, which have been associated with disease severity and persistent infection in other viruses but have not been described for Powassan virus. Here, we show that Powassan virus produces abundant defective RNAs in field-caught ticks, and that expression patterns of these defective RNAs changes after one passage in mammalian cells. Although the function of these defective RNAs remains unknown, this work establishes a critical framework for investigating the role of defective RNAs in Powassan virus replication and transmission.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615757", "title": "Inferring Time-Varying Internal Models of Agents Through Dynamic Structure Learning", "authors": "Moongathottathil James, A.; Bethus, I.; Muzy, A.", "author_corresponding": "Alexandre Muzy", "author_corresponding_institution": "Universite Cote d\\\\\\'Azur", "date": "2024-10-01", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "animal behavior and cognition", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/01/2024.09.30.615757.source.xml", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) models usually assume a stationary internal model structure of agents, which consists of fixed learning rules and environment representations.

This structural flexibility enables a deeper understanding of how individuals learn and adapt in real-world scenarios. The DSL framework reconstructs the most likely sequence of agent structures--sourced from a pool of learning rules and environment models--based on observed behaviors. The method provides insights into how an agents internal structure model evolves as it transitions between different structures throughout the learning process. We applied our framework to study rat behavior in a maze task. Our results demonstrate that rats progressively refine their mental map of the maze, evolving from a suboptimal representation associated with repetitive errors to an optimal one that guides efficient navigation. Concurrently, their learning rules transition from heuristic-based to more rational approaches. These findings underscore the importance of both credit assignment and representation learning in complex behaviors.

However, IMS experiments tend to yield large datasets, routinely recording over 200,000 ion intensity values per mass spectrum and more than 100,000 pixels, i.e., spectra, per dataset. Traditionally, IMS data size challenges have been addressed by feature selection or extraction, such as by peak picking and peak integration. Selective data reduction techniques such as peak picking only retain certain parts of a mass spectrum, and often these describe only medium-to-high-abundance species. Since lower-intensity peaks and, for example, near-isobar species are sometimes missed, selective methods can potentially bias downstream analysis towards a subset of species in the data rather than considering all species measured.\n\nResultsWe present an alternative to selective data reduction of IMS data that achieves similar data size reduction while better conserving the ion intensity profiles across all recorded m/z -bins, thereby preserving full spectrum information. Our method utilizes a low-rank matrix completion model combined with a randomized sparse-format-aware algorithm to approximate IMS datasets. This representation offers reduced dimensionality and a data footprint comparable to peak picking, but also retains complete spectral profiles, enabling comprehensive analysis and compression.

BindCraft leverages the trained deep learning weights of AlphaFold21 to generate nanomolar binders without the need for high-throughput screening or experimental optimization, even in the absence of known binding sites. We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins, and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas9. We showcase their functional and therapeutic potential by demonstrating that designed binders can reduce IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples.

We employ multiscale modeling and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the mechanisms of diffusive electron transfer in mitochondrial supercomplexes, composed of respiratory complexes III and IV (CIII and CIV). Using a combination of bioinformatic and entropy maximization tools, we model an ensemble of structures representing the conformational space of CIIIs disordered QCR6  hinge within the yeast CIII2CIV2 supercomplex. Molecular and Brownian Dynamics simulations of the entire supercomplex reveal a mechanism for electrostatic coupling between these negatively charged hinge conformations, and binding and directional diffusion of the redox proteins on the mitochondrial membrane, which is simulated over the millisecond timescale. Anionic lipids reinforce this conformationally-coupled recognition of the supercomplex by retaining a pool of the redox proteins in the vicinity of the membrane when the hinges are of a critical length. Cryo-EM models reveal a large-scale rearrangement of the {Delta}QCR6 supercomplex, which retains a surprisingly robust electrostatic environment for recognition of the redox protein, despite compromise in the supercomplexs negative charge, still enabling a surface-mediated electron transfer in this CIII2CIV2 variant. Altogether, the evolutionary need of confining electron carriers on the surface of bioenergetic membranes is found to give rise to a refolding-guided diffusion model of the redox proteins, which improves the energy conversion efficiency within the supercomplex by nearly 30%.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615872", "title": "Metabolic vulnerabilities in Down syndrome B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be targeted using Venetoclax", "authors": "Jones, D.; Woods, E.; Li, Z.; Schaller, K.

Leukemia cell lines (CLs) have been fundamental to understanding therapeutic responses to pharmacological agents. We generated three DS B-ALL CLs characterized with diverse genomic alterations, including IGH::CRLF2 rearrangement (BCR::ABL1 like), mutations in FLT3 and TP53, and a novel ERG::CEBPD rearrangement. DS CLs had diminished proliferation, metabolism, and mitochondrial function when compared to non-DS (NDS) CLs and interestingly, these findings were similar to NDS Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) B-ALL CLs. Based on similar mitochondrial defects and prior preclinical data using Venetoclax for Ph-like B-ALL, we hypothesized that Venetoclax would be effective in DS. Intriguingly, Venetoclax was more effective in DS when compared to both NDS and Ph-like CLs. Efficacy was observed in DS patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and diagnostic/relapsed patient samples treated with Venetoclax, which synergized with Trametinib and Vincristine. Mass spectrometry-based multiomics analyses in DS and NDS B-ALL patient samples revealed an enriched metabolite profile in DS, particularly in the hubs of glucose metabolism and polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylinositols. Transcriptome analyses in DS B-ALL patients (n=249) supported enhanced glucose and fatty acid metabolism; along with a reliance on BCL2 family members for apoptosis resistance.

We aimed to identify whether acid excretion capacity is disturbed in calcium oxalate (CaOx) or calcium phosphate (CaP) stone formers.\n\nMethodUrinary, serum, clinical, and anthropomorphic baseline data were obtained from the Swiss Kidney Stone Cohort, a prospective, longitudinal, and multi-centric observational study. We included in this study 193 non-stone formers (NSF, confirmed by negative CT scan), and 309 CaOx and 28 CaP stone formers. Titratable acids, net acid excretion (NAE), NAE capacity (NAEC) and acid-base (AB) score were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the potential associations of various acid-base variables with the occurrence of CaOx kidney stones.\n\nResultsCaOx stone formers showed a disturbed capacity to excrete acids in comparison to NSF (NAEC NSF = 3.49{+/-}12.6 mmol/24h; CaOx = -1.06{+/-}13.10; CaP = 0.97{+/-}14.70 and AB score NSF = 20.5{+/-}6.36 mmol/24h; CaOx = 17.9{+/-} 6.53; CaP = 18.8{+/-}6.10). The correlation between urine calcium and urine pH was altered in CaOx stone formers and between urine calcium and NAE was stronger in CaP stone formers. Logistic models showed that urinary ammonium was negatively associated with CaOx stone formation (unadjusted model, odds ratio 0.43[0.32-0.58], p< 0.001 for CaOx). Urine calcium was positively associated with CaOx kidney stones (2.85 [2.11-3.92], p<0.001). Similar results were obtained after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Replacing urine ammonium, pH, and phosphate with NAEC or ammonium and pH with AB score in our logistic regression models showed that NAEC and AB score are strongly associated with CaOx kidney stone formation.\n\nConclusionAmmonium excretion, NAEC and AB score are associated with the occurrence of CaOx kidney stones suggesting a potential role of proximal tubule dysfunction in their formation.

CPK28 regulates immune homeostasis, stress responses, and growth in multiple angiosperms including tomato 2,3, rice 4-7, cotton 8-10, and Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter, Arabidopsis)11-17. In Arabidopsis, CPK28 phosphorylates and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligases PLANT U-BOX 25 (PUB25) and PUB26 that target the major immune signaling protein BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1), resulting in its turnover 12,18. The CPK28-PUB25/26-BIK1 regulatory module maintains precise levels of BIK1 in the cell and is thought to optimize immune responses 19. Separated from angiosperms by 450M years of evolution, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (hereafter, Marchantia) has emerged as a model system to study the evolution of signaling modules across land plants 20. Here, we demonstrate that the function of CPK28 is conserved in Marchantia. MpCPK28 displays Ca2+-dependent protein kinase activity and is inhibited by calmodulin in vitro. Over-expression of MpCPK28 results in pronounced developmental phenotypes and decreased chitin-induced oxidative burst, and MpCPK28 can functionally complement the mutant phenotypes of the Arabidopsis cpk28-1 mutant.

Considerable debate remains over how mesolimbic dopamine responds to aversion and in the context of aversive conditioning. Inconsistencies may arise from the use of aversive stimuli that are transduced along different neural paths relative to reward or the conflation of responses to avoidance and aversion. Here, we made intraoral infusions of sucrose and measured how dopamine and behavioral responses varied to the changing valence of sucrose. Pairing intraoral sucrose with malaise via injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) caused the development of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA), which rendered the typically rewarding taste of sucrose aversive upon subsequent re-exposure. Following CTA formation, intraoral sucrose suppressed the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons (VTADA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine release. This pattern of dopamine signaling after CTA is similar to intraoral infusions of innately aversive quinine and contrasts with that to sucrose when it was novel or not paired with LiCl. Dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioral reactivity to intraoral sucrose and predicted home cage sucrose preference. Further, dopamine responses scaled with the strength of the CTA, which was increased by repeated LiCl pairings and weakened through extinction.

Periorbital allodynia and spontaneous pain behavior were assessed using von Frey test and grimace score, respectively. Quantitative PCR was used to assess extent of mTBI pathology. RNA sequencing was performed to obtain transcriptomic profile of the trigeminal ganglion (TG), trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and periaqueductal gray (PAG) at 7 days post-TBI. Subsequently, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to examine mRNA and protein expression of glia specific markers and pain associated molecules. The repetitive impacts at the bregma, but not pre-bregma site led to periorbital hypersensitivity, which was correlated with enhanced inflammatory gene expression in multiple brain regions. RNA sequencing revealed mTBI induced distinct transcriptomic profiles in the peripheral TG and central Sp5C and PAG. Using gene set enrichment analysis, positive enrichment of non-neuronal cells in the TG and neuroinflammation in the Sp5C were identified to be essential in the pathogenesis of PTH. In situ assays also revealed that gliosis of satellite glial cells in the TG and astrocytes in the Sp5C were prominent days after injury. Furthermore, immunohistochemical study revealed a close interaction between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes correlating with increased calretinin interneurons in the Sp5C. Transcriptomics analysis indicated that non-neuronal cells in peripheral TG and successive in situ assays revealed that glia in the central Sp5C are crucial in modulating headache-like symptoms. Thus, selective targeting of glia cells can be a therapeutic strategy for PTH attributed to repetitive mTBI.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615756", "title": "Do pollinators play a role in shaping the essential amino acids found in nectar?", "authors": "Parkinson, R.

A curated dataset of 1003 whole-genome sequences (WGS) was created which represented the global diversity of the species, including all previously identified clades and genetic clusters (GCs).

Site-level analysis was performed using PAML with omegaMap for confirmation. Selection along branches separating clades A and B were also investigated using PAML branch-site models and HyPhy. PAML site analysis revealed 17 genes under selection, including six hypothetical genes, most of which were linked to metabolism or transport. Several genes were associated with antimicrobial resistance, such as ileS which confers resistance to mupirocin. cysG and sirC, which catalyse the first two steps in the synthesis of siroheme, were also under selection. Two genes were found to be under selection at the branch-site level by both PAML and HyPhy, of which only one, rhtC, has been functionally characterised.

Purinergic signaling is known for its role in inflammation, muscle contraction, pain sensation, and cell proliferation in many systems, suggesting its potential importance in normal prostate function and pathological conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. To better understand purine-converting enzymes and purinergic receptors in the prostate, we isolated mouse prostate glands for immunofluorescent staining and microscopy imaging using specific antibodies. Our study identified a differential expression profile of purinergic enzymes and receptors in the prostate: ENTPD1 and P2x1 receptors predominantly in prostate smooth muscle cells, ENTPD2 and NT5E in prostate interstitial cells, and ALPL in prostate epithelial cells. Functionally, in addition to the P2x1-mediated prostate smooth muscle contraction induced by agonist ,{beta}-meATP, we observed an ATP{gamma}S-induced contraction force after P2x1 desensitization. This led to the identification of multiple P2Y receptors in mouse prostate smooth muscle, including P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y11 receptors, which potentially mediate the ATP{gamma}S-induced contraction force.

The mitosome retains ubiquinone and iron sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathways, both of which require protein import that relies on the membrane potential. It was previously proposed that the membrane potential is generated by electrons transferred through an alternative respiratory pathway coupled to a transhydrogenase (TH) that pumps hydrogens out of the mitosome. This pathway relies on an alternative oxidase (AOX) and type II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2), which also exists in plants, some fungi, and several protozoan parasites. To examine this model, we determined the location and function of AOX and NDH2 in C. parvum. Surprisingly, we observed that NDH2 was localized to parasite surface membranes instead of the mitosome. Furthermore, a {Delta}ndh2 knockout (KO) strain was readily obtained, indicating that this protein is not essential for parasite growth. Although, AOX exhibited a mitosome-like staining pattern, we readily obtained an {Delta}aox knockout strain, indicating that AOX is also dispensable for parasite growth. The growth of the {Delta}aox strain was inhibited by the AOX inhibitors SHAM and 8-HQ to the same extent as wild type, indicating that AOX is not the target of these inhibitors in C. parvum. Collectively, our studies indicate that NDH2 and AOX are non-essential genes in C. parvum, necessitating an alternative mechanism for maintaining the mitosome membrane potential.\n\nImportanceCryptosporidiosis is the leading cause of diarrhea in young children and immunocompromised individuals, particularly AIDS/HIV patients. The only FDA approved drug against cryptosporidiosis, nitazoxanide, has limited effectivity in immunocompromised patients and is not approved for usage in children under 1 year old. Genomic analysis and previous studies proposed an alternative respiration pathway involving alternative oxidase (AOX) and type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH2), which are thought to generate the mitosome membrane potential in C. parvum. Additionally, AOX and NDH2 were nominated as potential drug targets, based on their absence in mammalian hosts and sensitivity of parasite growth to known inhibitors of AOX. However, our study demonstrated that NDH2 is not localized in mitosome, AOX non-essential for parasite growth, and knockout lines lacking this enzyme are equally sensitive to AOX inhibitors. These findings indicate that AOX and NDH2 are not ideal candidates for future drug development against cryptosporidiosis and force a re-evaluation for models of how the mitosome generate its membrane potential.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616031", "title": "The MutRS quorum sensing system controls lantibiotic mutacin production in the human pathogen Streptococcus mutans", "authors": "Wyllie, R.

Existing clinical testing for BV is primarily based upon physical and microscopic examination of vaginal secretions, while more modern PCR-based clinical tests target panels of BV-associated microbes, such as the Labcorp NuSwab(R) test.\n\nRemnant clinician-collected NuSwab(R) vaginal swabs underwent DNA extraction and 16S V3-V4 rRNA gene sequencing to profile microbes in addition to those included in the Labcorp NuSwab(R) test. Community State Types (CSTs) were determined using the most abundant taxon detected in each sample. PCR results for NuSwab(R) panel microbial targets were compared against the corresponding microbiome profiles. Metabolic pathway abundances were characterized via metagenomic prediction from amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).\n\nSequencing of 75 remnant vaginal swabs yielded 492 unique 16S V3-V4 ASVs, identifying 83 unique genera. NuSwab(R) assay microbe quantification was strongly concordant with quantification by sequencing (p << 0.01). Samples in CST-I (18 of 18, 100%), CST-II (3 of 3, 100%), CST-III (15 of 17, 88%), and CST-V (1 of 1, 100%) were largely categorized as BV-negative via the NuSwab(R) panel, while most CST-IV samples (28 of 36, 78%) were BV-positive or BV-indeterminate. BV-associated microbial and predicted metabolic signatures were shared across multiple CSTs.\n\nThese findings show that 16S V3-V4 rRNA gene sequencing robustly reproduces PCR-based BV diagnostic testing results, accurately discriminates vaginal microbiome CSTs dominated by distinct Lactobacilli, and further elucidates BV-associated bacterial and metabolic signatures.\n\nImportanceBacterial vaginosis (BV) poses a significant health burden for women during reproductive years and onward. Current BV diagnostics rely on either physical and microscopic evaluations by technicians or panels of select microbes. Here, we sequenced the microbiome profiles of samples previously diagnosed by the Labcorp NuSwab(R) test to better understand disruptions to the vaginal microbiome during BV.

In the present study, we report a novel signalling pathway involving Protein Phosphatase PfPPM2, which regulates asexual division of the parasite as well as its conversion to sexual forms. Phosphoproteomics revealed that PfPPM2 may regulate the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in chromatin remodelling and protein translation. One of the key PfPPM2-targets that emerged from these studies was Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), a regulator of heritable gene silencing which contributes to both mitotic proliferation as well as sexual commitment of the parasite. We demonstrate that PfPPM2 promotes sexual conversion by regulating the interaction between HP1, H3K9me3 and chromatin and it achieves this by dephosphorylating S33 of HP1. Regulation of HP1 and Histone H3 by PfPPM2 may also contribute to division. In addition, PfPPM2 also regulates protein synthesis in the parasite by repressing the phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2, which is likely to contribute to parasite division and possibly sexual differentiation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616123", "title": "Group B streptococci lyse endothelial cells to infect the brain in a zebrafish meningitis model", "authors": "Ravishankar, S.; Tuohey, S.

Most studies on how bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier have been performed in vitro using cultured endothelial cells, due to a paucity of animal models. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in neonates and is primarily thought to cross the blood-brain barrier by transcytosis through endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we used optically transparent zebrafish larvae. Timelapse confocal microscopy revealed that GBS forms extracellular microcolonies in brain blood vessels and causes perforation and lysis of blood-brain barrier endothelial cells, which promotes bacterial entry into the brain. Vessels infected with GBS microcolonies were distorted and contained thrombi. Inhibition of clotting worsened brain invasion, suggesting a host-protective role for thrombi. The GBS lysin cylE, implicated in brain invasion in vitro, was found dispensable in vivo. Instead, pro-inflammatory mediators associated with endothelial cell damage and blood-brain barrier breakdown were specifically upregulated in the zebrafish head upon GBS entry into the brain. Therefore, GBS crosses the blood-brain barrier in vivo not by transcytosis, but by endothelial cell lysis and death. Given that we observe the same invasion route for a meningitis-associated strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, our findings suggest that streptococcal infection of brain blood vessels triggers endothelial cell inflammation and lysis, thereby facilitating brain invasion.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.29.615295", "title": "Teicoplanin attenuates RNA virus infection in vitro", "authors": "Espano, E.; Kim, J.; Park, S.

Considering the original indication of TP, we first determined the effects of TP against viruses that cause respiratory tract infections and found that TP inhibits enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses, namely: human and avian influenza viruses; representative coronaviruses including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and SARS-CoV-2; measles virus; human respiratory syncytial virus A2; and enterovirus 71 (EV-71). Representative flaviviruses, Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), were also susceptible to inhibition by TP. In contrast, TP did not attenuate infection of human adenovirus 5, a non-enveloped DNA virus. Addition of TP at the endocytosis stage but not at the attachment/binding stage of PEDV infection reduced PEDV production in vitro, indicating cathepsin inhibition. Meanwhile, addition of TP during either the attachment/binding or the endocytosis stage of ZIKV infection reduced ZIKV particle production in host cells, and in silico modeling suggested that TP has potential binding pockets in the envelope proteins of ZIKV and DENV2.

The full-length galETKM mRNAs 3 end is acquired by exo-nucleolytic processing of the 3-OH ends of the pre-full-length transcripts. However, the gal operon produces an mRNA named galE whose 3 end forms at [~]120 nucleotides from the galE stop codon, thus in the following gene, galT, establishing polarity in gene expression. In this study, we investigated the molecular processes that generate the 3 end of galE mRNA. We discovered that the 3 ends of pre-galE mRNA are produced in the middle of the galT gene as a result of the combination of two separate molecular processes - one previously reported as RDT and the other as unreported RNase E-mediated transcript cleavage. The 3 ends of the pre-galE mRNA are exo-nucleolytically processed to the current 3 end of the galE mRNA. A hairpin structure of 8 base-pair stems and 4 nucleotide-loop formed 5-10 nucleotides upstream of the 3 ends of the galE mRNA blocks the exoribonuclease digestion and renders stability. These findings showed that RNase E produces RNA 3end establishing polarity in gene expression, in contrast to the general role of mRNA degradation.\n\nSignificance statementHere, we show the findings of two molecular mechanisms that generate the pre-galE mRNA 3ends in the gal operon: Rho-dependent termination (RDT) and RNase E-mediated cleavage. These 3 ends are subsequently processed to produce stable galE mRNA with a hairpin structure that prevents exoribonuclease degradation. This mechanism establishes gene expression polarity by generating the 3 end of galE mRNA within the galT gene, contrasting with the usual mRNA degradation role of RNase E.

Therefore, heterotrophic bacteria such as Cupriavidus sp. have been intensively explored for the synthesis of the biodegradable polymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). PHB is also naturally produced by a variety of phototrophic cyanobacteria, which only need sunlight and CO2, thereby allowing a CO2 negative, eco-friendly synthesis of this polymer. However, a major drawback of the use of cyanobacteria is the need of a two-stage production process, since relevant amount of PHB synthesis only occurs after transferring the cultures to conditions of nitrogen starvation, which hinders continuous, large-scale production.\n\nThis study aimed at generating, by means of genetic engineering, a cyanobacterium that continuously produces PHB in large amounts. We choose a genetically amenable filamentous cyanobacterium of the genus Nostoc sp., which is a diazotrophic cyanobacterium, capable of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) fixation but naturally does not produce PHB. We transformed this Nostoc strain with various constructs containing the PHB synthesis operon from Cupriavidus necator H16. In fact, while the transformants initially produced PHB, the PHB-producing strains rapidly lost cell viability. Therefore, we next attempted further optimization of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Finally, we succeeded in stabilized PHB production, whilst simultaneously avoiding decreasing cell viability. In conclusion, the recombinant Nostoc strain constructed in the present work constitutes the first example of a continuous and stable PHB production platform in cyanobacteria, which has been decoupled from nitrogen starvation and, hence, harbours great potential for sustainable, industrial PHB production.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616162", "title": "Trafficking and translation of mRNA in osteocyte dendrites", "authors": "Mazur, C.

Using molecular and imaging approaches, we demonstrated that a subset of mRNAs are enriched in Ocy454 osteocyte-like cell dendrites. To understand how certain mRNAs are directed to dendrites, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay with 7115 oligonucleotide sequences designed from the 3 untranslated regions of eight dendrite-enriched transcripts. We identified localization sequences within some 3UTRs that were both sufficient and necessary for trafficking to osteocyte dendrites, indicating that localization directions are specifically encoded in enriched transcripts.

Protein droplets recruited clathrin as a dense, curved lattice, with many cage-like structures. On two-dimensional condensates, HRS recruited clathrin as a dense flat assembly. Two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted the clustering of cholesterol in the underlying membrane, while cholesterol enhanced PI(3)P- dependent HRS recruitment on the membrane. On free-standing membranes, two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted membrane flattening. Overall, these results show that a two- dimensional HRS condensate creates a unique membrane structure for sorting cargo molecules, defining a new mechanism in membrane trafficking processes.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616159", "title": "Development of potent and selective CK1\u03b1 Molecular Glue Degraders", "authors": "Geng, Q.; Jiang, Z.; Byun, W.

However, missing knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways to these products hinders their expanded use. Nucleotide sequencing is key in pathway elucidation efforts, and analyses of natural products molecular structures, though seldom discussed explicitly, also play an important role by suggesting hypothetical pathways for testing. Structural analyses are also important in drug discovery, where many molecular representation systems - methods of representing molecular structures in a computer-friendly format - have been developed. Unfortunately, pathway elucidation investigations seldom use these representation systems. This gap is likely because those systems are primarily built to document molecular connectivity and topology, rather than the absolute positions of bonds and atoms in a common reference frame, the latter of which enables chemical structures to be connected with potential underlying biosynthetic steps. Here, we present a unique molecular representation system built around a common reference frame. We tested this system using triterpenoid structures as a case study and explored the systems applications in biosynthesis and structural diversity tasks. The common reference frame system can identify structural regions of high or low variability on the scale of atoms and bonds and enable hierarchical clustering that is closely connected to underlying biosynthesis. Combined with phylogenetic distribution information, the system illuminates distinct sources of structural variability, such as different enzyme families operating in the same pathway. These characteristics outline the potential of common reference frame molecular representation systems to support large-scale pathway elucidation efforts.\n\nSignificance StatementStudying natural products and their biosynthetic pathways aids in identifying, characterizing, and developing new therapeutics, materials, and biotechnologies. Analyzing chemical structures is key to understanding biosynthesis and such analyses enhance pathway elucidation efforts, but few molecular representation systems have been designed with biosynthesis in mind. This study developed a new molecular representation system using a common reference frame, identifying corresponding atoms and bonds across many chemical structures. This system revealed hotspots and dimensions of variation in chemical structures, distinct overall structural groups, and parallels between molecules structural features and underlying biosynthesis.

NW arenaviruses present a glycoprotein (GP) complex on the envelope surface of the virion, which orchestrates host-cell entry and is a key target of the immune response arising from infection and immunization. Each protomer of the trimeric GP is composed of a stable signal peptide (SSP), a GP1 attachment glycoprotein, and a GP2 fusion glycoprotein. To glean insights into the architecture of this key therapeutic target, we determined the crystal structures of NW GP1-GP2 heterodimeric complexes from Junin virus (JUNV) and Machupo virus (MACV). Due to the metastability of the interaction between GP1 and GP2, structural elucidation required the introduction of a disulfide bond at the GP1-GP2 complex interface, but no other stabilizing modifications were required. While the overall assembly of NW GP1-GP2 is conserved with that presented by Old World (OW) arenaviruses, including Lassa virus (LASV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), NW GP1-GP2 complexes are structurally distinct. Indeed, we note that when compared to the OW GP1-GP2 complex, the globular portion of NW GP1 undergoes limited structural alterations upon detachment from its cognate GP2. We further demonstrate that our engineered GP1-GP2 heterodimers are antigenically relevant and recognized by neutralizing antibodies. These data provide insights into the distinct assemblies presented by NW and OW arenaviruses, as well as provide molecular-level blueprints that may guide vaccine development.\n\nImportanceAlthough the emergence of New World (NW) hemorrhagic fever mammarenaviruses poses an unceasing threat to human health, there is a paucity of reagents capable of protecting against the transmission of these pathogens from their natural rodent reservoirs. This is, in part, attributed to our limited understanding of structure and function of the NW glycoprotein spike complex presented on the NW arenavirus surface. Here, we provide a detailed molecular-level description of how the two major components of this key therapeutic target assemble to form a key building block of the NW arenaviral spike complex.

The second messenger c-di-GMP regulates a vast array of cellular processes. It is produced by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDE). In A. vinelandii the absence of the AvgReg DGC impairs alginate synthesis while the absence of the PDE MucG increased alginate production. The effect of the different c-di-GMP levels was solely attributed to its essential role in activating the alginate polymerase complex. Here in we investigated the possible role of c-di-GMP in the control of algD transcription, encoding the key enzyme of the alginate biosynthetic pathway. At artificially high or reduced levels of c-di-GMP algD transcription was increased, or almost abrogated, respectively. Therefore, the role of the transcriptional regulator FleQ, one of the best characterized c-di-GMP effectors, was investigated. Alginate production increased in the {Delta}fleQ relative to the wt strain, which agreed with increased algD transcription. These phenotypes were rescued in the {Delta}fleQ/fleQ+ complemented strain indicating a FleQ repressing effect. EMSA assay showed that FleQ was able to directly bind to the regulatory region of algD which agreed with the presence of a FleQ binding site overlapping its RpoS-dependent promoter. In A. vinelandii the c-di-GMP is also necessary for expression of alginate C-5 epimerase genes, essential for structuring mature cysts. Out data revealed that FleQ is not an intermediary in this regulation since its absence did not impair mature cyst formation nor affected expression of algE1-6 genes.

Competence mediated bacteriocin expression by S pneumoniae plays a major role in both the establishment and persistence of colonization on this polymicrobial surface. Over 20 distinct bacteriocin loci have been identified in pneumococcal genomes, but only a small number have been characterized phenotypically. In this work, we demonstrate that 3/4th of S. pneumoniae strains contain a highly conserved scb locus that encodes an active lactococcin 972-like bacteriocin called Streptococcin B. In these backgrounds, the scbABC locus is part of the early competence cascade due to a ComE binding site in the promoter region. Streptococcin B producing strains target both members of the population that have failed to activate competence and the 25% of the population that carry a naturally occurring deletion of the ComE binding site and the functional bacteriocin gene. The ComR-type regulator found directly upstream of the scb locus in S. pneumoniae strains can activate scb expression independent of the presence of the ComE binding site but only when stimulated by a peptide that is encoded in the scb locus of S. pseudopneumoniae, a closely related bacterium which also inhabits the human nasopharynx. Given the co-regulation with competence and the phenotypic confirmation of activity, Streptococcin B represents a previously unrecognized fratricide effector that gives producing strains an additional advantage over the naturally occurring deleted strains during colonization.\n\nImportanceStreptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis and otitis media. In order to successfully colonize humans, a pre-requisite to the development of invasive disease, S. pneumoniae must compete with other bacterial inhabitants of the nasal surface for space and nutrients. Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that typically target neighboring bacteria by disruption of the cell surface. S. pnuemoniae encodes a large number of potential bacteriocin, but, for most, their role in competitive interactions has not been defined. This work demonstrates that isolates that produce the bacteriocin Streptococcin B have an advantage over non producers.

With neurofilament phosphorylation controlling several processes of intermediate filament dynamics, its dysregulation may play a role in ARSACS. Accordingly, we investigated the interaction between CK1 (Casein Kinase 1) and its adaptor proteins FAM83H or FAM83B (FAMily with sequence similarity 83). Here, we report that these target proteins are upregulated in ARSACS patient fibroblasts and co-localize at the sites of intermediate filament bundling. In the Sacs-/- cerebellum, FAM83B compensated for the lack of FAM83H expression, suggesting a cell-type specific activity of CK1 that depends on the relative expression of its adaptor proteins. Further, CK1 inhibition with D4475 or knockdown of the target proteins with the CRISPR system caused neurofilament bundling, a phenotype that was only partially remedied by CK1 activation with SSTC3.

Raman imaging combined with chemometric classification via Cluster Analysis facilitated a comprehensive biochemical analysis of the proteomic, lipidomic, and DNA profiles of the human oocyte. Our findings indicate that cytochrome c is a crucial protein in oocyte mitochondria, essential for both cellular respiration (via oxidative phosphorylation) and apoptosis.

In this study, we characterize changes in TCR T cells interactions with cancer cells from live-cell imaging data using explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We train convolutional neural networks to distinguish behaviors in TCR T cell with CRISPR knock outs of CUL5, RASA2, and a safe harbor control knockout. We use explainable AI to identify specific interaction types that define different knock-out conditions. We find that T cell and cancer cell coverage is a strong marker of TCR T cell modification when comparing similar experimental time points, but differences in cell aggregation characterize CUL5KO and RASA2KO behavior across all time points. Our pipeline for discovery in live-cell imaging data can be used for characterizing complex behaviors in arbitrary live-cell imaging datasets, and we describe best practices for this goal.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616165", "title": "Structure of the CABIT2 domain of THEMIS reveals a novel protein fold with an inserted SH3-like domain", "authors": "Beyett, T.

Active thin sheet folding promises to be a powerful design technique in the fields of active solids, soft robotics, and synthetic biology. However, the general principles of active thin sheet folding remain poorly understood. Here we discover a non-canonical cilia-driven thin sheet folding behavior exhibited by basal animal Trichoplax adhaerens. Through volumetric imaging, we found that, despite having no nervous system, T. adhaerens has the remarkable ability to resolve complex body folding states in a non-stereotypical fashion using a carpet of collectively flocking cilia. Cilia-resolved imaging revealed that folds create crease defects in the animals ciliary carpet, which act as information bottlenecks to break collective behavior of cilia. In turn, these bottlenecks enable the disjointed locomotion required for fold removal. These findings point to a two-way coupling mechanism, wherein ciliary activity shapes the animals folding state and vice versa. Our work demonstrates the broad configuration space of non-stereotypical active folding and highlights the power of distributed activity to drive folding and unfolding of a thin multicellular sheet.

To successfully infect, colonize and complete their life cycle, plant pathogens are under constant selective pressures imposed by hosts, leading to genetic adaptation and possibly lineage radiation or speciation. Population and comparative genomics approaches are powerful tools to identify signatures of selection associated with host specialization in pathogen genomes and further allow recapturing population histories. Implementing such approaches, we identified evolutionary signatures of divergent host specialisation in distinct lineages of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, a major disease causing-agent of wheat. Unique collections of Z. tritici were isolated from wild (Aegilops spp.) and domesticated (Triticum aestivum) host grasses in the Middle East and whole-genome sequencing was performed in a selected subset of isolates from each collection. We observed distinct population structure between the two host-diverging pathogens and identified particular genomic features in the Aegilops-infecting isolates that may have shaped their evolutionary history. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that A. cylindrica and A. tauchii -infecting populations of Z. tritici form separate clusters, possibly reflecting incipient speciation driven by divergent host specialization. Using infection experiments, we confirm that Z. tritici isolates collected from Aegilops spp. only infect their respective host species and not T. aestivum. Population genomics analyses and demographic inference furthermore allowed us to detect signatures of recent selection and show that divergence of the wheat-infecting lineage likely coincided with wheat domestication. At last, we confirm a virulence-related role for one candidate effector located in a selective sweep region of the A. cylindrica-infecting pathogen.

Understanding the relationship between independent and coordinated finger movements along with their corresponding ECoG signals is crucial for precise brain mapping and neural prosthetic development. We analyzed subdural ECoG signals from three adult epilepsy patients with subdural electrode arrays implanted for seizure foci identification. Patients performed a cue-based task consisting of thumb flexion, index finger flexion or a pinching movement of both fingers together. Broadband power changes were estimated using principal component analysis of the power spectrum. All patients showed significant increases in broadband power during each movement compared to rest. We created topological maps for each movement type on brain renderings and quantified spatial overlap between movement types using a resampling metric. Pinching exhibited the highest spatial overlap with index flexion, followed by superimposed index and thumb flexion, with the least overlap observed for thumb flexion alone. This analysis provides practical insights into the complex overlap of finger representations in the motor cortex during various movement types, and may help guide more nuanced approaches to brain-computer interfaces and neural prosthetics.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study measured brain activity actively during finger movement and found that pinching movements show higher cortical overlap with index finger flexion and uniquely engage parietal regions, advancing our understanding of motor control hierarchy and sensorimotor integration, while suggesting improvements for more naturalistic brain-computer interfaces through prioritized index finger decoding and integration of parietal lobe measurements.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615419", "title": "A newly developed whole genome sequencing protocol enables early tracking of Enterovirus D68 molecular evolution.", "authors": "Giardina, F.

To achieve a timely genomic surveillance, a reliable, high-throughput EV-68 sequencing assay is required. Here we report an improved high-throughput EV-D68 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) assay performed directly on clinical samples that is suitable for short-read sequencing platforms. Between June and December 2022, a total 37 (1.9%) respiratory samples were EV-D68 positive and together with 52 additional samples with a median cycle threshold of 28.3, ranging from 18 to 36.8 were included in the validation analyses. Overall, all the primers had good performance and no mismatches were detected in more than 85% of sequences (932 WGS dataset). Using a cut-off of Cq <32 in at least 85.5% of samples a WG or PG was obtained, confirming an acceptable positive sequencing rate for the designed method. A total of 65 WGS were obtained and have a mean coverage of 98.4% across the genome, with a median depth of 6158x (range 2815x-7560x).

Obesity-associated dysregulated lipid metabolism is believed to contribute to the increasing risk of breast cancer. However, the mechanisms linking lipid dysregulation to breast cancer risk and progression remain to be determined. The family of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) evolves to facilitate lipid transport and metabolism. As the predominant isoforms of FABP members expressed in breast tissue, adipose FABP (A-FABP, also known as FABP4) and epithelial FABP (E-FABP, FABP5) have been shown to play critical roles in breast carcinogenesis. In this study, we collected surgical breast tissue samples from 96 women with different subtypes of breast cancer and comprehensively analyzed the expression pattens of FABP4 and FABP5. We found that distinct expression profiles of FABP4 and FABP5 were associated with their unique roles in breast cancer development. FABP4, mainly expressed in breast stroma, especially in adipose tissue, supported neighboring tumor cell lymphvascular invasion through secretion from adipocytes. In contrast, FABP5, primarily expressed in epithelial-derived tumor cells, promoted tumor metastasis by enhancing lipid metabolism. Thus, elevated levels of FABP4 and FABP5 could serve as poor prognostic markers for breast cancer.

The spatial distribution of mRNA encodes their dynamics, including inherently spatial processes like transport to the nuclear boundary for export. Due to the technical challenges of spatial stochastic processes, tools for studying these subcellular spatial patterns are still limited. Here, we introduce a spatial stochastic model of nuclear mRNA with telegraph transcriptional dynamics. Observations of the model can be concisely described as following a spatial Cox process driven by a stochastically switching partial differential equation (PDE). We derive analytical solutions for spatial and demographic moments and validate them with simulations. We show that the distribution of mRNA counts can be accurately approximated by a Poisson-Beta distribution with tractable parameters, even with complex spatial dynamics.

This study re-analyzed raw data, previously processed using a standard 2D microglial morphology analysis method, using 3D analysis methods.

How these GTPases are appropriately positioned at the opposite poles of a migrating cell is unknown. Here we leverage optogenetics, manipulation of cell mechanics, and mathematical modeling to reveal a surprising long-range mutual activation of the front and back polarity programs that complements their well-known local mutual inhibition. This long-range activation is rooted in two distinct modes of mechanochemical crosstalk. Local Rac-based protrusion stimulates Rho activation at the opposite side of the cell via membrane tension-based activation of mTORC2. Conversely, local Rho-based contraction induces cortical-flow-based remodeling of membrane-to-cortex interactions leading to PIP2 release, PIP3 generation, and Rac activation at the opposite side of the cell. We develop a minimal unifying mechanochemical model of the cell to explain how this long-range mechanical facilitation complements local biochemical inhibition to enable robust global Rho and Rac partitioning. Finally, we validate the importance of this long-range facilitation in the context of chemoattractant-based cell polarization and migration in primary human lymphocytes.

Biological drivers of RHI-related neurodegeneration are not well understood. We interrogated the plasma proteome in aging adults with prior RHI compared to healthy controls (CTL) and individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), including a subset characterized neuropathologically at autopsy.\n\nMethodsProximity extension assay (Olink Explore(R)) quantified 2,779 plasma proteins in 22 RHI patients (all AD-biomarker negative), 39 biomarker-confirmed AD, and 44 CTL. A subset of participants went to autopsy (N=16) allowing for comparisons of the antemortem plasma proteome between autopsy-confirmed CTE+ (N=7) and CTE-(N=9). Differential abundance and co-expression network analyses identified plasma proteomic signatures of RHI, which were functionally annotated using gene ontology and cell type enrichment analysis. Nonparametric correlations examined plasma proteomic associations with orthogonally-measured plasma biomarkers, global cognitive function, and semi-quantitative ratings of neuropathology burden at autopsy.\n\nResultsDifferential abundance analysis revealed 434 increased (vs. 6 decreased) proteins in RHI vs. CTL and 193 increased (vs. 14 decreased) in RHI vs. AD. Network analysis identified 9 protein co-expression modules (M1-M9), of which 7 were elevated in RHI compared to AD or CTL. Modules with increased abundance in RHI were enriched for mitochondrial/metabolic, cell division, and immunovascular (e.g., cell adhesion, TNF-signaling) processes. RHI-related modules exhibited strong and selective correlations with immunoassay-based plasma IL-6 in RHI cases, including the M2 TNF-signaling/cell adhesion module which harbored proteins that strongly tracked with cognitive function. RHI-related plasma protein signatures were similar in the subset of participants with autopsy-confirmed CTE, including immune and metabolic modules that positively correlated with medial temporal lobe tau and TDP-43 burden.\n\nConclusionsMolecular pathways in plasma most consistently implicated in RHI were tied to immune response, mitochondrial function, and cell metabolism. RHI-related proteomic signatures tracked with antemortem cognitive severity and postmortem neuropathological burden, providing converging evidence for their role in disease progression.

This controversy may be due to the heterogeneity in B cell populations, as the balance among the subtypes may impact tumor progression. The immunosuppressive regulatory B cells (Breg) release IL-10 but only represent a minor population. Additionally, tumor-specific antibodies (Ab) also exhibit anti-tumor and pro-tumor function dependent on the Ab isotype. Transcription factor c-Maf has been suggested to contribute to the regulation of IL-10 in Breg, but the role of B cell c-Maf signaling in anti-tumor immunity and regulating antibody responses remain unknown.\n\nMethodsConditional B cell c-Maf knockout (KO) and control mice were used to establish a KPC pancreatic cancer model and B16.F10 melanoma model. Tumor progression was evaluated. B cell and T cell phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and cytokine/chemokine profiling. Differentially expressed genes in B cells were examined by using RNA-seq. Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy donors and melanoma patients for B cell phenotyping.\n\nResultsCompared to B cells from spleen and lymph nodes, B cells in the pancreas exhibited significantly less follicular phenotype and higher IL-10 production in naive mice. c-Maf deficiency resulted in a significant reduction of CD9+ IL-10-producing Breg in the pancreas. PDAC progression resulted in accumulation of circulating B cells with follicular phenotype and less IL-10 production in the pancreas. Notably, B cell c-Maf deficiency delayed PDAC tumor progression and resulted in pro-inflammatory B cells. Further, tumor volume reduction and increased effective T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) were observed in B cell c-Maf KO mice in the B16.F10 melanoma model. RNA-seq analysis of isolated B cells revealed that B cell c-Maf signaling modulates immunoglobulin (Ig)-associated genes and tumor specific antibody production. We furthermore demonstrated c-Maf-positive B cell subsets and increase of IL-10-producing B cells after incubation with IL-4 and CD40L in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients.\n\nConclusionOur study highlights that B cell c-Maf signaling drives tumor progression through the modulation of Breg, inflammatory responses, and tumor-specific Ab responses.\n\nWhat is already known on this topicThe net effect of B cells on tumor immunity depends on the balance of various B cell subtypes. c-Maf has been suggested to contribute to the regulation of IL-10 in regulatory B cells (Breg), but the role of B cell c-Maf signaling in anti-tumor immunity remains unknown.\n\nWhat this study addsThis study shown that B cell c-Maf signaling drives tumor progression in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We defined different anti-tumor mechanisms of B cell c-Maf deficiency in two tumor models. Specifically, c-Maf signaling modulates the pro-inflammatory phenotype of B cells in the KPC tumor-bearing pancreas and tumor-specific antibody responses in tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLN) of melanoma.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policyThese studies indicate that inhibition of c-Maf signaling is a novel and promising approach for immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer and melanoma.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615768", "title": "SIRT4 enhances the cytotoxicity of NK cells toward hepatic stellate cells and reverses liver fibrosis via AMPK\u03b1/P-p53/NKG2DL pathway", "authors": "Zhang, F.; Chen, H.; Da, B.; Cai, Z.; Fang, R.; Zhang, H.; Xie, X.; Zhao, S.; Zhang, M.; Wang, L.; Xu, B.; Zhuge, Y.", "author_corresponding": "Feng Zhang", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "cell biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.09.30.615768.source.xml", "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells exhibit antifibrotic properties in liver fibrosis (LF) by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rDNA copy number across wild isolates ranges from 90 to 300 copies. Previous studies showed that 35 rDNA copies are sufficient for ribosome biogenesis in this yeast and enable wild-type-like growth in standard laboratory growth conditions. We addressed two major questions concerning rDNA copy number variation in this yeast: (1) What are the fitness consequences of rDNA copy number variation outside and within the natural range in standard laboratory growth conditions? (2) Do these fitness effects change in different growth conditions? We used growth competitions to compare the fitness effects of rDNA copy number variation in otherwise isogenic strains whose rDNA copy number ranged from 35 to 200. In standard growth conditions, we found that fitness gradually increases from 35 rDNA copies until reaching a plateau that spans from 98 to 160 rDNA copies, well within the natural range. However, rDNA copy number-dependent fitness differed across environments. Compared to standard growth conditions, strains with higher rDNA copy numbers showed improved fitness when grown at increased temperature or in glycerol media. Moreover, the gradual fitness increase with increasing rDNA copy number in standard growth conditions gave way to a markedly lower fitness of strains with copy numbers below the natural range in these two stress conditions. These results suggest that selective pressures drive rDNA copy number in this yeast to at least ~100 copies and that a higher number of copies buffers against environmental stress. The similarity of the S. cerevisiae rDNA copy number range to the ranges reported in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and humans points to conserved selective pressures maintaining the range of natural rDNA copy number in these highly diverse species.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616091", "title": "Proton channel inactivation results in loss of chloroplast NDH complex activity", "authors": "Strand, D.

In this study, we took a structure-function approach and mutated the plastid genome-encoded ndhF gene to abolish the NdhF proton channel of the NDH complex. These mutations led to loss of plastoquinone reductase activity, indicating tight coupling between the proton and electron transfer reactions within NDH. Additionally, loss of the transverse helix of NdhF led to loss of the NDH complex, suggesting that this region of the NdhF subunit is required for complex stability. In agreement with previous studies using ndh knockout mutants, loss of NDH complex activity did not result in measurable changes in rates of steady-state cyclic electron flow.

The multivalent presentation and sustained exposure of RBD antigens improved the potency, neutralizing activity, durability, and consistency of antibody responses across homologous and heterologous coronavirus strains in a naive murine model. When administrated in animals previously exposed to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 antigens, liposomal hydrogels elicited durable antibody responses against the homologous SARS and MERS strains for over 6 months and elicited neutralizing activity against the immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron BA.4/BA.5.

Yet, most vaccines still do not mount durable protection against mutagenic viruses and fail to induce broad responses to protect against emergent strains. Materials approaches to vaccine design, such as employing sustained delivery approaches or decorating nanoparticle constructs with multiple antigens, have shown promise in improving the breadth and potency of vaccines. Yet, these approaches typically require cumbersome chemistries and have not been explored in pre-exposed populations over clinically relevant time scales. Here, we report the development of an injectable liposomal hydrogel depot technology capable of prolonged presentation of multiple coronavirus antigens non-covalently coordinated on the surface of the liposomes forming the hydrogel structure. These hydrogels improve the potency, durability and breadth of vaccine response and are easy to fabricate, enabling the rapid design of next generation vaccines that confer protection against rapidly evolving pandemics.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615695", "title": "Single Nuclei Sequencing Reveals Replication Stress in Adrenocortical Carcinoma", "authors": "Popova, L.

Despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes, little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins. Using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered microscopic, fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins. In contrast to subtidal species, the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections.

To explore the role of CPT1a upregulation in response to pathological stress, mice were subjected to afterload stress via transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery (sham) with cardiac-specific CPT1a knockdown or cardiac-specific, AAV9-mediated CPT1a overexpression (AAV9.cTNTN.Cpt1a), versus empty virus or PBS infusions as controls. MiR370, known to suppress hepatic CPT1a, was assayed and overexpressed to determine if miR370 regulates cardiac CPT1a expression.\n\nResultsCPT1a protein was elevated and miR370 reduced in myocardium of male and female NICM patients (204% vs. non-failing unused donor hearts), as well as in failing mouse hearts. AAV mediated miR370 overexpression in mouse hearts suppressed CPT1a expression and attenuated the response of CPT1a to TAC. Preventing CPT1a upregulation in response to TAC in cardiac specific CPT1a knockout mice (csCPT1a ko) exacerbated adverse remodeling, causing severe dysfunction and increased mortality. In contrast, CPT1a overexpression (2.8 fold), attenuated impaired ejection fraction (EF, by 54%) and fractional shortening (FS, 65%) vs. PBS-infused TAC hearts (p<0.05). Delivery of AAV9.cTnT.Cpt1a 4 wks after TAC surgery, led to significant rescue of EF and FS vs. animals receiving empty virus and mitigated the exacerbated dysfunction of csCPT1a ko hearts at 4 wks TAC. RNA-seq and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed a novel function of CPT1a in suppressing hypertrophic, profibrotic and cell death gene programs in both sham and TAC hearts, irrespective of changes in FAO.\n\nConclusionsThe effects of CPT1a in the heart extend beyond FAO and include a non-canonical regulation of cardiac gene programs. In addition to an animal model of HF, CPT1a upregulation occurs in NICM, and is a critical cardioprotective adaptation to pathological stress.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615990", "title": "Reduced Synaptic Heterogeneity in a Tetanus ToxinModel of Epilepsy: Insights from ComputationalModeling", "authors": "Zarei Eskikabd, P.; Cook, M.

By viewing distant landmarks, animals recall spatial memories and plan future trajectories. Although these spatial functions depend on hippocampal place cells, the relationship between place cells and active visual behavior is unknown. Here, we studied a highly visual animal, the chickadee, in a behavior that required alternating between remote visual search and spatial navigation. We leveraged the unique head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast, ballistic head movements called \"head saccades\". On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade. We suggest that place and gaze coding are components of a unified process by which the hippocampus represents the location that an animal is currently attending to.

To study this, we used the regenerative abilities of the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris, which displays a striking planar pattern of actin fibers at the organism scale. Cellular aggregates formed from dissociated Hydra cells initially lose all actin polarity yet can regenerate a long-range actin pattern within a week. We quantified the appearance of the actin pattern with orientational (nematic) and positional (smectic) order parameters and showed that the actin organization evolves over days from a disordered to an ordered state. During the first hours, the actin meshwork displayed spatial heterogeneity in the orientational order parameter, and ordered domains progressively grew and fused. To better understand the mechanism driving the ordering, we perturbed the tissues physical constraints. We showed that while topology and geometry do not have a direct effect, stretch can strongly bias the orientation of the actin meshwork within hours. Surprisingly, although the Wnt gradient is expected to play an essential role in the actin alignment, the stretch-associated alignment bias happened without a Wnt enrichment. This showed the role of tissue mechanics in the alignment of the actin fibers.

The cave morphs, also known as cavefish, have adapted to the dark and nutrient-scarce cave environments, resulting in distinct metabolic reprogramming that has made them persistently hyperglycemic, resilient to starvation, and prone to fat accumulation. Focusing on metabolic evolution in cavefish, we used liver tissue to conduct genome-wide contact mapping through Hi-C experiments. Comparing the 3D genome architecture of two cave morphs - Pachon and Tinaja - with that of surface fish, we observed significant changes in genome compartmentalization and genomic loops.

Here, we find that cancer-associated mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) can uncouple p53 activity from tumor suppression by perturbing chromatin states that determine target gene expression. Mutant IDH impairs tumor regressions and promotes the outgrowth of cancer cells with transcriptionally active, wild-type p53 in a mouse model of liver cancer where restoration of p53 activity results in tumor clearance. Mutant IDH alters p53 target gene expression through the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an inhibitor of alpha-ketoglutarate (KG)-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, without preventing p53 accumulation or global genomic binding. Rather, mutant IDH alters chromatin accessibility landscapes that dictate target gene expression, resulting in disabled upregulation of targets that execute tumor suppression. Specifically, mutant IDH disrupts the expression of pro-apoptotic p53 targets that enable p53-dependent tumor regressions, including the death ligand receptor Fas. Pharmacological inhibition of mutant IDH in TP53 wild-type cholangiocarcinoma cells, a tumor type where p53 and IDH mutations are mutually exclusive, potentiates p53 target gene expression and sensitizes cells to Fas ligand and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we implicate the disruption of p53 target gene regulation as a reversible, oncogenic feature of cancer-associated IDH mutations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe find that chromatin states altered by cancer-associated IDH mutations intersect with transcriptional regulation of p53 target genes.

Often referred to as type 3 diabetes, Alzheimers disease (AD) shares a close association with hyperglycemia and insulin dysregulation. Despite this, anti-diabetic medications have proven beneficial in reducing cognitive impairment induced by T2D. Previous research, including our own, has highlighted the dysregulation of Cdk5 activity in both T2D and AD, with downstream consequences contributing to the progression of pathophysiological changes in both disorders. Therefore, targeting the kinase Cdk5 may offer a more effective approach to treating T2D and cognitive deterioration. In our study, we present evidence supporting Cdk5 as a significant mediator between T2D and cognitive decline. Through the screening of the KINACore library, we identified novel brain-penetrant Cdk5 inhibitors, BLINK11 and BLINK15. Our study further validated the efficacy of these inhibitors in a high-fat diet-induced T2D model, demonstrating their rescue effects on T2D pathogenesis, including blood glucose levels, obesity, and cognitive impairment as assessed through behavioral studies. Notably, BLINK11 emerges as a promising Cdk5 inhibitor for improving the T2D phenotype and addressing cognitive impairment in T2D conditions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615976v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5b670org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c8472org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab91e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7d1f5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.09.30.615914", "title": "Sociality shapes mitochondrial adaptations supporting hypoxia tolerance", "authors": "Rossi, A.; Ruwolt, M.; Kakouri, P.; Kosten, T.; Kunz, S.; Puchkov, D.; Reznick, J.; Omerbasic, D.; Aranda, D.

One prominent exception is the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) which is remarkably adapted to withstand prolonged periods ([~]18 mins) of severe hypoxia, a trait likely driven by its crowded underground lifestyle. Other African mole-rat species are less social or entirely solitary like the Cape mole-rat (Georychus capensis). Here, we asked whether cellular and molecular adaptations to hypoxia map to social traits. We discovered that at the cellular level naked mole-rat fibroblasts survive >30 hours in 1% oxygen, while fibroblasts from terrestrial or non-social mole-rat species (human, mouse and Cape mole-rat) die rapidly under hypoxic conditions. We further show that naked mole-rat mitochondria have evolved morphological, functional and proteomic adaptations crucial for hypoxia resistance, remaining unaffected after long periods of severe hypoxia. We identify the mitochondrial protein Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) as a key player in naked mole-rat hypoxia resilience. Naked mole-rat mitochondria not only express more protective forms of OPA1, but also harbor a structurally unique isoform that likely protects cells from hypoxic damage. We show that evolutionary changes including the functionalization of a unique Opa1 exon support mitochondrial mediated cellular protection. Indeed, knockdown of OPA1 in naked mole-rat cells is sufficient to render them equally susceptible to hypoxia as human cells or cells from non-social African species. Our study demonstrates how molecular evolution drives unique adaptations that enable cells to achieve unprecedented resistance to hypoxic damage. We also show that molecular changes at the level of mitochondria are crucial in conferring hypoxia resistance. Our results thus chart a novel molecular path to understand how robust cellular hypoxia resistance can be achieved.

This study addresses a mechanism by which subendothelial calcifications can increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake into the arterial wall.\n\nMethodsMice overexpressing tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in endothelial cells (eTNAP mice) were used as a model of calcification. Calcification and atherosclerosis were detected by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. The endothelial roughness was characterized by surface metrology. A fluid-structure interaction model was used to calculate wall shear stress (WSS). The uptake of fluorescent LDL was traced in vitro and in vivo. Human arteries were assessed for the prevalence of internal elastic lamina (IEL) calcification.\n\nResultseTNAP mice developed more severe aortic atherosclerosis than controls on the LDL receptor mutant background (p<0.01). Subendothelial calcifications in eTNAP mice were confirmed by micro-CT. An increase in aortic surface area roughness, including the height, volume, and steepness parameters, was observed in eTNAP mice compared to controls (p<0.01). Calcifications affected near-wall hemodynamics, creating pockets of reduced WSS. Endothelial cells cultured on rough surfaces showed increased LDL uptake compared to cells cultured on smooth collagen (p<0.0001). Fluorescent LDLs were traced to subendothelial calcifications in eTNAP mice but not in controls. In humans, IEL calcification was prevalent in older adults and inversely correlated with arterial diameter (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionSubendothelial calcification is sufficient to perturb near-wall hemodynamics, creating localized areas of reduced WSS, consistent with increased LDL uptake near calcified lesions.

Studies using auditory stimulation consistently observed enhanced evoked responses in tonic versus phasic REM, indicating that the external processing is largely diminished when the eyes move during REM sleep. Whereas exteroceptive processing during sleep is widely studies, investigation on interoception (the processing of bodily signals) during sleep is scarce, and limited to scalp electroencephalographic recordings.

Evoked potentials and beta-low gamma spectral power locked to the heartbeat were significantly different in phasic REM compared to tonic REM and wakefulness. Heartbeat-related neural signals exhibited pronounced inter-trial phase synchronization at lower (7-20 Hz) oscillatory activity in all vigilance states, but reduced gamma synchronization at later time points in phasic REM only.

Recently we reported an important role of the interaction between DUSP3 and nucleophosmin (NPM) proteins on the regulation of the p53 actions to maintain genomic stability. Since both p53 and NPM often have mutations related to a diverse set of leukemia, this work aimed to evaluate the roles of DUSP3 in the differentiation of two acute myeloid leukemia cell lines not expressing the p53 protein, and the potential correlations with NPM expression. The results demonstrated higher levels of DUSP3 in THP-1 cells compared to HL-60 cells under basal conditions. After PMA-induced differentiation into macrophages, only HL-60 cells presented a dramatic decrease in DUSP3 and NPM proteins expression. The permanent DUSP3 knockdown in THP-1 and HL-60 cells contributed to their differentiation and non-classical polarization after PMA exposure, since the CD14, MHCII, and CD163 markers were decreased whereas the CD11b and CD206 markers were increased. Bioinformatics analyses identified that the negative regulation of the npm1 and dusp3 genes correlates with the reduced survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the strong positive correlation existing between the expression of these two genes is progressively lost according to the degree of maturation of the myeloid cells.

However, integrating data generated from different cohorts with different platforms, such as microarray and RNA-seq, often requires data preprocessing, including normalization. In this study, we empirically evaluate 9 commonly used cross-platform normalization methods. We classify these methods into two main types: joint and separate normalization. Joint methods normalize multiple datasets together, while separate methods normalize each dataset independently. We further divide these methods into unsupervised and supervised approaches depending on whether they use outcomes during their nor-malization process. Examples of joint unsupervised methods include Quantile Nor-malization (QN), while Rank-in serves as an example of a joint supervised method. Training Distribution Matching (TDM) is an example of a separate unsupervised method. We assess each methods ability to cluster samples, predict outcomes, and detect differentially expressed (DE) genes using three real datasets and simulated data. First, our real data analysis suggests that while joint supervised methods can cluster sample groups better than the other two method groups, they double use the outcome data with artificially inflated clustering performance. Their biases are further demonstrated by their inflated type I error in DE analysis and clustering results from simulated data with no DE genes. Second, for outcome prediction, supervised normalization is no longer applicable. Among the unsupervised methods, QN significantly outperforms the other approaches, regardless of whether RNA-seq data is used to predict microarray outcomes or vice versa. Finally, we compare normalization methods on downstream DE analysis using simulation. In addition to direct DE analysis on the combined normalized data using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we also perform a meta-analysis that combines p-values of the DE analysis from each individual data. For DE analysis, the meta-analysis consistently achieves the best balance between controlling type I error and maximizing power for DE gene detection.

To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must attach to microtubules from opposing spindle poles, a configuration referred to as biorientation. To avoid chromosome missegregation the conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. While Aurora B localizes to the centromere and inner kinetochore as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without fully disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction and whether additional mechanisms may facilitate tension-dependent phosphorylation of substrate proteins.\n\nIn this study, we identify the conserved KMN subcomplex Spc105Knl1/Kre28Zwint as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helical bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 cause defective mitotic error correction, closely resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. In biochemical experiments we show that Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with the KMN network via the Spc105/Kre28 subcomplex and that binding is inhibited by Ipl1 autophosphorylation. The phenotype of the kre28 mutant cells can be efficiently suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1, demonstrating the importance of Ipl1 docking to the outer kinetochore.

TOP2B binds predominantly to inter-LAD (iLAD) chromatin and its depletion results in a partial loss of genomic partitioning between LADs and iLADs, suggesting that its activity might protect specific iLADs from interacting with the NL. TOP2B depletion affects LAD interactions with lamin B receptor (LBR) more than with lamins.

Masked autoregressive flows, a deep learning technique, is also tested as an alternative do MGM models.

We describe Miniature, a tool to automatically generate informative image thumbnails from multiplexed tissue images in an unsupervised and scalable manner. Miniature aims to aid researchers in understanding tissue heterogeneity and identifying potential pathological features without extensive manual intervention. Miniature uses a choice of unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods including uniform manifold embedding and projection (UMAP), t-distributed stochastic neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and principal Component analysis (PCA) to reduce on-tissue pixels from a low-resolution, high dimensional image to two or three dimensions. Pixels are then color encoded by their coordinate in low dimensional space using a choice of color maps. We show that perceptually distinct regions in Miniature thumbnails reflect known pathological features seen in both the source multiplexed tissue image and H&E imaging of the same sample. We evaluate Miniature parameters for dimensionality reduction and pixel color encoding to recommend default configurations that maximize perceptual trustworthiness to both the low-dimensional embedding and high-dimensional image and provide high Mantel correlation between the perceived color difference (delta E 2000) and distance in high- and low-dimensional space.

These peptide therapeutics form a class of successful inhibitors.

In the current work, we use computer simulations to investigate p53 peptides stapled with hydrocarbon chains of different lengths and positions of attachment to the peptide. We subsequently analyze their binding efficiency with MDM2. The introduction of stapling agents restricts the conformational dynamics of peptides, resulting in higher persistence of helicity. The efficiency of the stapling agents has also been verified imposing these stapled peptides to adverse conditions viz. thermal and chemical denaturation. In addition, the conformational exploration of peptides has been investigated using Temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (T-REMD) simulations. From both the unbiased and T-REMD simulations, p53 with a long hydrocarbon cross-linker shows a more conformationally rigid structure having high helicity compared to other stapled peptides. The rigidity gained due to cross-linking reduces the entropy of the peptide in the free state and thereby facilitates the complexation process. From the binding studies, we have shown that the peptide having multiple short staples has shown a larger enthalpy change during binding free energy, resulting from its orientation and interactions of residues in the binding interface. On the other hand, a peptide with a single long stapling agent shows less entropic penalty than other systems.

Proofreading is typically invoked in the context of error correction and therefore is often inflexible in its discrimination in favor of the cognate ligand.

Here, we present a novel non-equilibrium and tunable kinetic sorting mechanism that allows signaling networks to modulate ligand discrimination in direction as well as in magnitude. In our model, the  restart cycle associated with traditional proofreading is coupled with a topologically distinct and ligand-identity independent cycle, e.g., through receptor degradation or activity-induced desensitization. The signaling network can kinetically sort the non-equilibrium flux of receptors bound to one of the ligands towards degradation/desensitization and the other through the restart cycle. This preferential diversion of the non-equilibrium flux allows the network to switch its ligand discrimination by altering biochemical processes that are not specific to the identity of the bound ligand, thereby allowing cells to respond to ligands in a context-specific manner. Our model recapitulates several observations related to paradoxical ligand discrimination by the Epidermal Growth Factor pathway.

In sleep, theta is prominent in periods of rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep. Theta has been linked to processes of memory consolidation; however, its mechanistic contribution specifically during REM sleep is not well understood. Interestingly, in the wake state, frontal theta activity increases during effortful cognitive tasks involving executive functions such as working memory, hinting at similarities in circuitry, and potentially, function. The aim of the present work is to create a spatially resolved, whole-brain characterisation of REM oscillatory activity in healthy human subjects, distinguishing theta from neighbouring frequency bands, differentiating substages of REM sleep (phasic and tonic REM), and comparing REM theta to that which is evoked during a working memory task. To that end, we analysed magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) data recorded during overnight sleep in 10 healthy subjects, and similar data from 17 healthy subjects who performed a working memory task, using a novel whole-brain, source-localised MEG approach. Our results show that (i) theta activity has a frontal midline topography that is distinct from those of other prominent frequency bands in REM (delta, alpha, beta), (ii) theta activity in frontal midline regions is best observed within a focused 5-7 Hz range, separating it from occipital alpha activity, (iii) REM theta is dominant over the frontal midline but is also observed in several sub-cortical areas, (iv) theta is more widespread in tonic than phasic REM sleep, and (v) the focused frontal midline theta pattern observed in REM phasic sleep is the most similar of all observed sleep substages to theta evoked by a working memory task.

Our recent work suggests that a primary pathogenic mechanism of Dravet syndrome is impaired action potential propagation along axons of cortical parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons (PVINs). Ectopic action potentials (EAPs) are action potentials that initiate distal to the axon initial segment. We recently demonstrated that a large proportion of PVINs fire EAPs during periods of increased excitation. Although their function remains unknown, EAPs may play a role in amplifying (when occurring in excitatory cells) and/or preventing seizures (when occurring in interneurons). Regardless of function, their generation in distal axons suggests that EAP frequency could be a useful proxy for distal axonal excitability. We hypothesized that EAPs are attenuated in PVINs from Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/-) mice due to dysfunction of the distal axon. We induced EAPs in PVINs in acute brain slices prepared from male and female wildtype (WT) and Scn1a+/- mice at P18-21 and P35-56, when we have previously identified axonal conduction deficits in Scn1a+/- PVINs. We elicited EAPs in 17/22 (77%) of WT PVINs, including 6 (22%) that exhibited barrages of EAPs. In contrast, Scn1a+/- PVINs never fired barrages (0%), and only 8/23 (34%) exhibited even single EAPs. This finding adds to the body of evidence supporting impaired action potential propagation in Dravet syndrome PVINs, and is the first evidence of impaired EAP firing in a disease model, suggesting that dysregulation of EAPs could be involved in the pathophysiology of human disease.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.615823", "title": "Mapping grey and white matter activity in the human brain with isotropic ADC-fMRI", "authors": "Spencer, A.

Further, through minimising vascular contamination, ADC-fMRI has the potential to overcome the limited temporal specificity of the BOLD signal. However, the use of linear diffusion encoding introduces sensitivity to fibre directionality, while averaging over multiple directions comes at great cost to temporal resolution. In this study, we used spherical b-tensor encoding to impart diffusion sensitisation in all directions per shot, providing an ADC-fMRI contrast capable of detecting activity independently of fibre directionality. We provide evidence from two task-based experiments on a clinical scanner that isotropic ADC-fMRI is more temporally specific than BOLD-fMRI, and offers more balanced mapping of grey and white matter activity.

Here, we explore the molecular link between SCZ-associated genes and developmental neuronal remodeling, focusing on the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), which undergoes stereotypic remodeling during metamorphosis. We conducted a loss-of-function screen in which we knocked down Drosophila homologs of human genes that genomic studies have associated with SCZ. Out of our  positive hits, we focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), mostly known for their role in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. We found that both Mmp1 and Mmp2, which are closely-related to mammalian MMPs, are required in neurons and in glia for the pruning of MB axons. Our combinatorial loss-of-function experiments suggest that Mmp2 secretion from glia is the most important promoter of axon pruning.

We observed three key features of the estimated descending activation patterns: (1) Within about the first 15% of movement duration, descending and muscle activations are temporally aligned.

Recent advances in computational modelling allow us to investigate the relationship between FC and neurobiology non-invasively. These techniques allow for targeted manipulations to study the effect of network disturbances on FC. Most modelling research has concentrated on replicating empirical static FC (sFC). However, FC changes over time, and its dynamic properties are closely linked to behaviour and symptomatology.\n\nIn this study, we adapted computational models to reflect both sFC and dynamic FC (dFC) of individuals, allowing for a more comprehensive characterisation of the neurobiological origins of FC. We modelled the brain activity of 200 healthy individuals based on empirical resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Simulations were conducted using a group-averaged structural connectome and four parameters guiding regional brain activity: i) G, a global coupling scaling parameter; ii) J_i, the local inhibitory current; iii) J_NMDA, the excitatory NMDA synaptic coupling parameter; and iv) w_p, the excitatory population recurrence weight. We evaluated the models based on four metrics: a) the sFC, b) the FC variance, c) the temporal correlation (TC), and d) the node cohesion (NC). The optimal model for each subject was identified by the fit to both sFC and TC. We analysed associations between brain-wide sFC and TC features with optimal model parameters and fits with a univariate correlation approach and multivariate prediction models. In addition, we used a group-average perturbation approach to investigate the effect of coupling in each region on overall network connectivity.\n\nOur models could replicate empirical sFC and TC but not the FC variance and NC. Both fits and parameters exhibited strong associations with brain connectivity. G correlated positively and J_NMDA negatively with a range of static and dynamic FC features (|r| > 0.2, p(FDR) < 0.05). TC fit correlated negatively, and sFC fit positively with static and dynamic FC features. TC features were predictive of TC fit, sFC features of sFC fit (R2 > 0.5).

For caribou, costs and benefits may vary seasonally and by social context. To test the effects of season and social context on caribou movement and selection of potentially risky habitats, we used a socially informed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA). We tested responses to two forms of risk in Terra Nova National Park, NL: roads and areas burned 2 - 75 years prior. Caribou avoided areas near roads irrespective of season. Burned area avoidance varied by season and burn age. Caribou avoided roads less and selected burns more in a social context.

This issue has been particularly important in Animal Social Network Analysis (ASNA), where data are unevenly sampled and such biases may potentially lead to incorrect inferences about animal social behavior.

Using a set of simulation experiments designed to reflect various sampling and observational biases encountered in real-world scenarios, we systematically validate our model and evaluate its performance relative to other common ASNA methodologies. By accounting for differences in node-level censoring (i.e., the probability of missing an individual interaction.), our model permits the recovery of true latent social connections, even under a wide range of conditions where some key individuals are intermittently unobserved. Our model outperformed all other existing approaches and accurately captured network structure, as well as individual-level and dyad-level effects.

Predicting OATP-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is challenging due to limited structural data and inconsistent experimental OATP inhibition data across studies. This study introduces Heterogeneous OATP-Ligand Interaction Graph Neural Network (HOLI-GNN), a novel computational approach that integrates molecular modeling with graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of OATP-mediated drug inhibition. By combining ligand molecular features with protein-ligand interaction data, HOLI-GNN outperforms traditional ligand-based methods. HOLI-GNN achieved median F1 and AUC scores of 0.78 and 0.90, respectively, compared to ECFP- and RDKit-based models built upon XGBoost (F1: 0.68 and 0.78, respectively; AUC: 0.70 and 0.75, respectively). Beyond improving inhibition prediction, we characterize protein residues involved in inhibitory versus non-inhibitory drug interactions, specifically highlighting residues T42, F224, I353, F356, and F386. We speculate that local position shifts in these hydrophobic packing residues, or the inhibition thereof, may be an important aspect of competitive inhibition mechanisms. Our model enhances the performance of OATP inhibitor prediction and, critically, offers interpretable interaction information to inform future mechanistic investigations.\n\nSignificance StatementConcurrent administration of different drugs can cause potentially lethal drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and membrane protein transporters like OATPs can mediate such DDIs. While many current models predict OATP-mediated DDIs, all thus far rely solely on drug features without considering intricate drug-OATP interactions. In this work, we present HOLI-GNN, a graph neural network that leverages both drug and OATP-drug interaction features to predict OATP inhibition. The use of OATP-drug interaction features in the prediction was made possible by the recent publication of cryo-EM structures for OATP1B1 and high-throughput protein-ligand docking. We demonstrate that HOLI-GNN outperforms conventional OATP-mediated DDI predictors which rely solely on drug features, while enabling important mechanistic insights into OATP transport.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.614916", "title": "Rapid Prototyping of 3D Microstructures: A Simplified Grayscale Lithography Encoding Method Using Blender", "authors": "Borghi, F.

We repurposed the murine leukemia virus retroviral protein Gag to enable diverse types of immortalized and primary mammalian cells to package cellular RNA molecules in virus-like particles (VLPs) for export into the extracellular environment. We applied self-reporting to interrogate the transcriptome-wide dynamics that occur during neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells and detected gene expression profiles from individual live cells.

Pseudotyping VLPs with epitope-tagged envelope proteins enabled multiplexed selective live-cell readout of transcriptional states from heterogeneous co-cultures. Furthermore, structure-guided protein engineering of Gag fusions with human RNA binding domains improved the mRNA representation in self-reporting readouts and enabled the directed export of libraries of synthetic barcode transcripts.

EPR spectroscopy reveals the presence of a S2 state in a high spin configuration (S2HS) and in a low spin configuration (S2LS) in both mutants. In contrast to the S2HS in the wild type at high pH, the S2HS state in the D1-V185T mutant does not progress to the S3 state at 198 K. This inability is likely due to alterations in the protonation state and hydrogen-bonding network around the Mn4CaO5 cluster. Optical studies show that these mutations significantly affect proton release during the S3-to-S0 transition. While the initial fast proton release associated with TyrZ* formation remains unaffected within the resolution of our measurements, the second, and slower, proton release is delayed, suggesting that the mutations disrupt the hydrogen-bonding interactions necessary for efficient deprotonation of substrate water (O6). This disruption in proton transfer also correlates with slower water exchange in the S3 state, likely due to non-native hydrogen bonds introduced by the threonine or asparagine side chains at position 185. These findings point to a critical role of D1-V185 in regulating both proton transfer dynamics and water binding, underscoring a complex interplay between structural and functional changes in PSII.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616022", "title": "mTOR signaling promotes cytokine production in T cells through 3UTR-mediated translation control", "authors": "Jurgens, A.

Also, GFPs serve as fluorescent tags in size-exclusion chromatography and native-PAGE, facilitating the evaluation of expression levels and quality of the expressed fusion proteins. However, the fluorescent detection of GFPs is generally incompatible with denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), where the samples are heat-denatured before loading. Accordingly, detecting GFP-fused proteins after SDS-PAGE usually relies on western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies. To enable in-gel fluorescence detection of SDS-PAGE-separated GFPs, some protocols employ mild denaturing conditions to keep the GFPs intact. However, such mild denaturation sometimes results in partial denaturation of the proteins and irregular electrophoretic mobility that is not proportional to their molecular weights.

We discovered that asciminib, an allosteric inhibitor of BCR-ABL that binds to the myristoyl binding site in the ABL kinase domain, is >2000-fold less potent against TEL-ABL than BCR-ABL in cell-growth assays. This is surprising because the ABL components of the two fusion proteins, including the asciminib binding sites, have identical sequence. We deleted a short helical segment in the ABL kinase domain that closes over asciminib when it is bound. This deletion results in asciminib resistance in BCR-ABL, but has no effect on TEL-ABL, suggesting that the native autoinhibitory mechanism that asciminib engages in BCR-ABL is disrupted in TEL-ABL. We show, using mammalian cell expression and single-molecule microscopy, that BCR-ABL is mainly dimeric while TEL-ABL forms higher-order oligomers. Oligomerization can promote trans-autophosphorylation of ABL, and we find that a regulatory phosphorylation site in the SH3 domain of ABL (Tyr 89) is highly phosphorylated in TEL-ABL. This phosphorylation is expected to disassemble the autoinhibited conformation of ABL, thereby preventing asciminib binding. We show that TEL-ABL is intrinsically susceptible to inhibition by asciminib, but that increased phosphorylation results in resistance. Our results demonstrate that different ABL fusion proteins can have dramatically different responses to allosteric inhibitors due to differential phosphorylation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWhen TEL-ABL is phosphorylated, it is insensitive to asciminib.

HBDs bind histones through multi-contact interactions that may confer more specificity than antibodies, but are hard to study because of their weaker affinity in vitro. To explore the large HBD design space, we developed the \"Cell-Free Histone-Binding Immunoassay\" (CHIA) where interactions between cell-free-expressed HBD proteins and immobilized biotinylated histone peptides are measured in an ELISA-style assay.

Previous work created an AgDNV co-expression system with a wild-type AgDNV helper plasmid and a transducing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressing plasmid that can be used to co-transfect cells to generate infectious recombinant transducing AgDNV virions. Generated virions infect the An. gambiae midgut, fat body, and ovaries, yet this viral vector system is limited in the size of transgenes that can be expressed due to capsid packaging limitations. Considering these size constraints, we created an artificial intron within the EGFP gene of the transducing construct that can express small pieces of genetic material such as microRNAs (miRNAs), microRNA sponges, or other small sequences. Placement of this intron in EGFP created a fluorescent reporter such that incorrect splicing produces a frameshift mutation in EGFP and an early stop codon whereas correct splicing results in normal EGFP expression and co-transcription of the intronic genetic cargo. A selection of miRNAs with predicted or demonstrated importance in mosquito immunity and reproduction with expression localized to the fat body or ovaries were chosen as intronic cargo, construct expression and splicing evaluated, and the impact of miRNA expression on putative miRNA targets was measured in vitro and in vivo. While the intron was correctly spliced in cells and mosquitoes, miRNA delivery resulted in inconsistent changes to miRNA and target gene transcript levels--possibly due to organ-specific miRNA expression or miRNA-target gene sequence mismatch.

These findings illuminate a fundamental aspect of how ubiquitous DNA organizers are primed for genome maintenance and demonstrate how this process can be disrupted by viruses.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=193 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616235v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (68K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23096forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40598eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7ae14org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105a88b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616307", "title": "Nanotextured steel surface exhibits antifungal activity", "authors": "Tripathi, A.; Champion, J.", "author_corresponding": "Julie Champion", "author_corresponding_institution": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "date": "2024-10-02", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "molecular biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/02/2024.10.02.616307.source.xml", "abstract": "Fungal adhesion to stainless steel, an alloy commonly used in food and beverage sectors, public and healthcare settings, and numerous medical devices, can give rise to serious infections, ultimately leading to morbidity, mortality, and significant healthcare expenses.

Anaerobic survival of microorganisms requires the formation of protein disulfide bond (DSB). The relation between environmental polysulfides and anaerobic DSB formation has not been studied so far. Herein, we discovered that environmental polysulfides can efficiently mediate protein DSB formation of microorganisms under anaerobic condition. We used polysulfides to treat proteins including roGFP2, Trx1, and DsbA under anaerobic condition and found that all three proteins formed intramolecular DSB in vitro. The growth of E. coli {Delta}dsbB was reduced and the amount of its intracellular protein DSB was decreased under anaerobic condition. However, treating the mutant strain with polysulfides recovered the growth and reversed DSB decrease. Treating E. coli {Delta}dsbA with polysulfides promoted DSB formation of its periplasmic roGFP2 and recovered its growth under anaerobic condition. In addition, treating Schizosaccharomyces pombe with polysulfides led to increase of the intracellular protein DSB content. Thus, our study reveals that environmental polysulfides can promote DSB formation independent of the enzymatic DSB mediating system and oxygen. In this aspect, environmental polysulfides are beneficial for the survival of microorganisms in anaerobic habitats.\n\nIMPORTANCEHow polysulfides benefit adaption of microorganisms to anaerobic environments are unclear. Our study reveals that environmental polysulfides efficiently facilitate protein DSB formation under anaerobic condition. Polysulfides contain zero valent sulfur atoms (S0), which can be transferred to the thiol group of cysteine residue. This S0 atom gets two electrons from two cysteine residues and becomes reduced H2S, leaving two cysteine residues in disulfide bond form. Anaerobic growth of microorganisms was benefited from the formation of DSB. This finding paves the way for a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between polysulfides and microorganisms in environmental contexts.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616323", "title": "Genome-wide in vivo dynamics of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion and its role in transcription activation", "authors": "Popay, T.

In addition to the reformation of 3D genome structures, mitotic exit coincides with widespread transcriptional activation. We found that NIPBL is essential for establishing the expression of lineage-defining genes during the M-G1 transition but has diminished impact on the steady-state maintenance of their expression. At genes sensitive to its depletion, NIPBL supports a unique local genome organization defined by greater spatial proximity to nearby super-enhancers and weaker transcription start site insulation of genomic contacts.

Over time senescent cells contribute to tissue deterioration through chronic inflammation and fibrosis driven by the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). The human ovary is one of the first organs to age, and prominent age-related fibroinflammation within the ovarian microenvironment is consistent with the presence of senescent cells, but these cells have not been characterized in the human ovary. We thus established a doxorubicin-induced model of cellular senescence to establish a \"senotype\" (gene/protein signature of a senescence cell state) for ovarian senescent cells. Explants of human postmenopausal ovarian cortex and medulla were treated with doxorubicin for 24 hours followed by culture for up to 10 days in a doxorubicin-free medium. Tissue viability was confirmed by histology, lack of apoptosis, and continued glucose consumption by explants. Single nuclei sequencing and proteomics revealed an unbiased signature of ovarian senescence. We identified distinct senescence profiles for the cortex and medulla, driven predominantly by epithelial and stromal cells. Proteomics uncovered subregional differences in addition to 120 proteins common to the cortex and medulla SASP. Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed 26 shared markers, defining a senotype of doxorubicin-induced senescence unique to the postmenopausal ovary. A subset of these proteins: Lumican, SOD2, MYH9, and Periostin were mapped onto native tissue to reveal compartment-specific localization.

Clinical use of Scl-Ab is indicated for postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis who are at high risk of, or have a history of, fragility fractures, which can occur many years after menopause. However, in early stages of estrogen deficiency there is rapid bone loss, which abates thereafter, whereas in the longer-term changes in bone mineralization occur. This study seeks to investigate whether administering intermittent low-dose monthly sclerostin antibody during early estrogen deficiency could mitigate osteoclastogenesis but also prevent osteocyte-driven secondary mineralization, due to apoptosis, perilacunar remodelling and osteocyte mechanosensitivity. Female Wistar rats that had completed their breeding cycles underwent bilateral ovariectomy as a model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. After 3 weeks of bone loss, one group received monthly low-dose Scl-Ab injections (2 mg/kg/month) and a control group remained untreated. We report that early treatment with intermittent low-dose Scl-Ab mildly increased bone formation, reduced TRAP+ osteoclasts and suppressed catabolic and matrix degradation gene expression (Sost, Ctsk, Mmp9) compared to untreated rats. There was a decrease in the percentage of empty lacunae and MMP14+ osteocytes, along with decreased gene expression associated with osteocyte-mediated mineralization (DMP1, PHEX, OPN, ALP) and mechanotransduction (Vcl, integrins 5, V, {beta}1, CX43, Axin2, IFT88, Adcy6, Pkd1, and Cav1).

We recently reported on the imiditides, a new RiPP family in which aspartimidylation is the class-defining modification. Imiditide biosynthetic gene clusters encode a precursor protein and a methyltransferase that methylates a specific Asp residue, converting it to aspartimide. A subset of imiditides harbor a tetracysteine motif, so we have named these molecules cysimiditides. Here, using genome mining we show that there are 56 putative cysimiditides predicted in publicly available genome sequences, all within actinomycetota. We successfully heterologously expressed two examples of cysimiditides and showed that the major products are aspartimidylated and that the tetracysteine motif is necessary for expression. Cysimiditides bind a Zn2+ ion, presumably at the tetracysteine motif. Using in vitro reconstitution of the aspartimidylation reaction, we show that Zn2+ is required for methylation and subsequent aspartimidylation of the precursor protein. An AlphaFold 3 model of the cysimiditide from Thermobifida cellulosilytica shows a hairpin structure anchored by the Zn2+-tetracysteine motif with the aspartimide site in the hairpin loop. An AlphaFold 3 model of this cysimiditide in complex with its cognate methyltransferase suggests that the methyltransferase recognizes the Zn2+-tetracysteine motif to correctly dock the precursor protein. Cysimiditides expand the set of experimentally-confirmed RiPPs harboring aspartimides, and represent the first RiPP class that has an obligate metal ion.\n\nTable of Contents Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616296v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2879corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152b63org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3ad25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8d63_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616211", "title": "Cross-catalytic enhancement of peptides and RNA from a common prebiotic activated intermediate", "authors": "Roy, R.; Sawant, A.

While the PACAP-38 isoform is more densely expressed than PACAP-27 in most of the brain, PACAP-27 is more highly expressed in the rodent paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), where females also have greater expression than males. Notably, the role of PACAP-27 expression in cells of the PVT has not been explored.\n\nMethodsAdult, female Long-Evans rats were injected in the PVT with an AAV to increase expression of PACAP or a control AAV. They were then investigated for subsequent gene and peptide levels of PACAP in the PVT; ethanol drinking and preference; sucrose drinking and preference; or locomotor activity in a novel chamber, behavior in a light-dark box, behavior in a novelty suppression of feeding test, locomotor activity in a familiar activity chamber, and behavior in a forced swim test.\n\nResultsGene expression of PACAP was significantly increased in the PVT by four weeks after injection with the PACAP AAV, and this resulted in a specific increase in levels of PACAP-27. Rats injected with the PACAP AAV demonstrated reduced drinking and preference for ethanol under the intermittent-access procedure compared to those injected with the control AAV.

So, for example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. But as well, anticipatory attention can be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs. green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where participants were cued to either attend to a color (blue or green) or a motion direction (up or down) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band (8-12 Hz) activity during the attention control period (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (color vs. motion) and specific feature attributes (blue vs. green; up vs. down). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (color vs. motion) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (e.g., blue vs. green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first biasing the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing to the specific feature attribute.\n\nSignificance StatementDuring voluntary feature-based attention, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have highlighted the role of anticipatory (top-down) biasing of the sensory cortex in enhancing the selection of attended stimulus attributes, but little is known about how this is achieved. In particular, it is not clear whether attending to an attribute such as a color (blue vs. green) or motion direction (up vs. down) first biases all neural structures coding that dimension (color/motion) before biasing the specific attribute, or if the top-down signals directly bias only the attended attribute. Using EEG and multivariate decoding, we report that top-down attention control follows a hierarchical organization: first, the broader attended feature dimension is biased, which is followed by the biasing of the specific feature attribute.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616300", "title": "Neural dynamics of spontaneous memory recall and future thinking in the continuous flow of thoughts", "authors": "Su, H.; Li, X.; Born, S.; Honey, C.

We found that transitions between thoughts, particularly those involving significant shifts in semantic content, activate the brains default and control networks. These neural responses to internally generated thought boundaries produce activation patterns resembling those triggered by external event boundaries. Moreover, interactions within and between these networks shape the overall semantic structure of thought trajectories: stronger functional connectivity within the medial temporal subsystem of the default network predicts greater variability in thoughts, while stronger connectivity between the control and core default networks is associated with reduced variability.

Hyperinvasive N. meningitidis strains often express a genomically encoded filamentous bacteriophage called MDA{Phi}, which promotes colonisation of mucosal host surfaces to facilitate invasion. How this phage is organised and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear. Here, we present an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the MDA phage, showing that MDA{Phi} is a class I filamentous inovirus, with the major capsid protein arranged within the phage as a highly curved and densely packed -helix. Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the major capsid protein presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage-phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis.

We explore these questions in Drosophila sensory organ precursors (SOPs), which divide asymmetrically to give rise to the epidermal mechanosensory bristles.

The influence of auditory feedback is best illustrated by manipulating it during speech production. A common temporal manipulation technique, delaying auditory feedback (DAF), leads to disruptions in speech fluency, while a common spectral manipulation technique, perturbing the pitch of auditory feedback (PAF), results in vocal alterations.\n\nPrevious research involving clinical populations has revealed diverse susceptibility profiles to auditory feedback manipulations, yet the extent of such diversity within the neurotypical population remains unclear. Furthermore, different types of manipulations elicit distinct speech errors (i.e. fluency/coordination versus acoustic errors), which may be processed by distinct error correction mechanisms. It is yet to be understood whether individuals affected by one manipulation are similarly impacted by the other. Lastly, based on evidence from clinical studies, which demonstrated that visual feedback can improve impaired speech production, it is an open question whether visual feedback can alleviate the disruptive effects of altered auditory feedback.\n\nWe recorded voice samples from 40 neurotypical participants during both a DAF and a PAF task. DAF significantly prolonged articulation duration and increased voice pitch and intensity. In some trials, participants received immediate visual feedback, however visual feedback did not alleviate but rather strengthened the disruptive effects of DAF. During the PAF task, participants adjusted their voice pitch in the opposite direction of the perturbation in majority of the trials to compensate for the perturbation. We assessed susceptibility of the participants to the effects of DAF and PAF by examining articulation duration and compensatory vocal response magnitude, respectively.

Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized function of the molecular motor protein KIF11, which acts as a MT dynamics rheostat in hippocampal neurons to modulate dendritic branching. Known for its role in mitotic spindle bipolarity, KIF11 is also implicated in Microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or intellectual disabilities (MCLID). However, the specific neuronal functions of KIF11 and the impact of its mutations in MCLID have remained largely unexplored. Our studies, using quantitative imaging of MT dynamics following KIF11 inhibition, indicate that KIF11 preferentially binds to parallel MTs in mature neurons. This binding is associated with a marked increase in minus-end-out MT dynamics in both axons and dendrites upon KIF11 loss of function, coupled with enhanced MT flux and extended growth in tertiary dendrites. These changes suggest a novel role for KIF11 in orchestrating dendritic branching. Moreover, introducing MCLID-associated KIF11 mutations, KIF11Y82F, and KIF11{Delta}Cterm, which cause minor microcephaly but severe intellectual disabilities, leads to significantly reduced MT dynamics and impaired dendritic arborization. In a microtubule sliding assay, KIF11Y82F significantly reduced KIF11 velocity while KIF11{Delta}Cterm increased it. Temporal inhibition of KIF11 using a photo-inhibitable KIF11, show increased MT dynamics and dendritic growth, while activation results in kinked and twisted branches.

Our findings reveal that exposure to heightened prenatal levels of maternal inflammation is linked to altered offspring hippocampal microstructure in late middle age, which could have implications for memory decreases during this period and may be relevant for understanding risk of aging-related cognitive changes.\n\nSignificance StatementThe contribution of prenatal maternal inflammation (PNMI) to offspring brain microstructure in later life is well established in animal models, but poorly understood in humans. Our study discovered long-lasting impacts of elevated PNMI during early-mid gestation on the structural integrity of the hippocampus in offspring during late middle age.

This is regulated by additional features taking place at the mitochondria membrane such as recruitment of the death executioner BAX, which, in response to BH3 binding antagonism, contributes to protein complex disruption.\n\nSummaryBCL-xL exerts an essential cell survival function which relies on its hydrophobic groove binding to BH3 domain of BH3-only initiators and downstream BAX/BAK executioners. Combining resonance energy transfer assays and molecular dynamics simulations, we unravel that the C-terminal tail mediated subcellular membrane anchoring of BCL-xL selectively advantages binding to membrane-anchored PUMA initiator over BH3 mimetic ligands of the groove. This is due to the combined allosteric effect on BH3-in-groove binding of BCL-xL and PUMA tail anchors. Moreover, doubly anchored PUMA / BCL-xL complexes recruit endogenous BAX, which favors their antagonism by BH3 mimetics. BAXs C-terminal tail anchor alone is sufficient to enhance BH3 mimetics induced death in cells expressing PUMA / BCL-xL. Thus, the survival function of BCL-xL is regulated by a complex interplay between its tail anchor and those of its interacting partners. This enables both resistance to pharmacological inhibitors and modulation by BAX, which functions as a crucial feedback disruptor of the BCL-xL network.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616265v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1000\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f162daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@190ee49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c30c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55a96d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsBH3 mimetic antagonism, and subsequent cell death, are limited when full length BCL-xL binds to some membrane-anchored BH3-only proteins such as PUMA.\n\nThe BH3-in-groove interface is allosterically modulated by tail anchors of PUMA and BCL-xL.\n\nBinding to PUMA enriches BCL-xL interactome and recruits BAX.\n\nBAX counteracts the effects of tail anchors in BCL-xL complexes.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616267", "title": "The Unique Role of Intracellular Perinuclear \u03b2-Adrenergic Receptors in defining Signaling Compartmentation and Pathological Cardiac Remodeling", "authors": "Turcotte, M.

The presence of multiple {Delta}9 desaturases has posed a significant challenge in developing a rapid and efficient approach to control UFA production in C. elegans and other model organisms.

To test this, the GBM neurospheres were treated with a myosin inhibitor, Blebbistatin. Myosin inhibition led to reduced GBM invasion and contractility.

However, the regulation of specific transcriptional signatures and the contribution of each individual response to disease progression is only starting to be characterized. We have previously shown that hypoxia via hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a strong regulator of A{beta} plaque-associated microglia (A{beta}AM). Here, we characterize the role of HIF1-mediated transcription of Egln3, encoding for PHD3, in A{beta}AM. We show that oligomeric A{beta} treatment (oA{beta}) in vitro induces the expression of Hif1a and Egln3 in microglia, which correlates with the transcriptional activation of genes involved in the interferon type I signature (IFNS) in a PHD3-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we demonstrate FOXO3 to be an important repressor of IFNS in microglia, whose abundance decreases upon A{beta} presence, and, correspondingly, both in human single-nucleus (sn) and mouse A{beta}AM transcriptomics, FOXO3 DNA binding sites define the IFNS. FOXO3 repression of the IFNS is dependent on PHD3, with our results suggesting a physical interaction between both proteins in vitro. In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlate with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature (DAM) in A{beta}AM. Transcriptional changes in microglia associate with increased microglia proximity to A{beta} plaques, augmented phagocytosis of A{beta} by microglia, reduced parenchymal levels of A{beta}, and an increase in small-sized plaques. PHD3 deficiency also reduced the A{beta} plaque-associated neuropathology and rescued behavioural deficits of an AD mouse model. Finally, we also demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression during development in the absence of A{beta} pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and to behavioural alterations.

A critical element in reproductive behavior is the investigative stage, which in mice, and many other species, strongly relies on chemosensation. While the initial approach mostly involves the main olfactory system (MOS), once physical contact is established, the vomeronasal system (VNS) is engaged to provide information about potential partners characteristics. Given the estrus-stage dependent behavioral response, we asked whether representations of male features in the first brain relay of the VNS, namely, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), change during the cycle. To this end, we used a stimulus set comprising urine samples from males from different strains and virility levels, and from estrus and non-estrus females. The stimulus set was designed to reveal if response patterns of AOB neurons conform to ethologically relevant dimensions such as sex, strain, and particularly, male virility state. Using extracellular recordings in anesthetized female mice, we find that most ethological categories contained in our data set are not over-represented by AOB neurons, suggesting that early stages of VNS processing encode conspecific information efficiently. Then, comparing neuronal activity in estrus and non-estrus females, we found that overall, response characteristics at the single neuron and population levels remain stable during the reproductive cycle.

Evidence from chemical sequencing of amino acid (aa) residues was likewise baffling, but consistent with a spiralised depolymerisation within the Edman reaction chamber of a unitary polypeptide. Data decryption has overcome molecular intractability, supported by the results of tryptic digestion and epitope mapping using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The detected inhibitory factor is sleuthed to relate to secretogranin II (SgII), the neurosecretory prohormone, in the form of a secreted acidic 70-aa polypeptide derivative called here SgII-70 ( sig two seventy). The product of peptide splicing, micrin/SgII-70 is potentially an amphipathic molecular ampersand (&), with ends entwined (via salt bridging), the knotty totality compromising Edman and MALDI analyses and molecular modelling whilst conferring protease and heat resistance. The two ends of the factor are conceptualised as binding at the same time to a dimeric cellular receptor, to stoichiometric effect, providing fewer smaller cells within a counting mechanism of tissue-mass regulation. Hexapeptide mimetics simulating both ends of the hormone together have been demonstrated in different species and settings, in the cause of antiorganotrophism (tissue reduction) and reproductive modulation. Therapeutic exploitation beckons for mimetics of the bodys hormonal brake, micrin/SgII-70, in tissue overgrowth conditions such as endometriosis, PCOS, BPH and cancer, and in infertility.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616072", "title": "Differential composition of lymphocyte subpopulations and activation between the hypertensive Bph/2 and normotensive Bpn/3 mouse strains", "authors": "Dattmore, D.

However, the inherent biological, chemical, and physical heterogeneity of soil complicates laboratory investigations into microbial phenotypes that mediate community metabolism. This difficulty arises from challenges in accurately representing the soil environment and in establishing a tractable microbial community that limits confounding variables. To address these challenges in our investigation of community metabolism, we use a reduced-complexity microbial consortium grown in a soil analog using a glass-bead matrix amended with chitin. Long-read and short-read metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metaproteomes, and metabolomes were analyzed to test the effects of soil structure and moisture on chitin degradation. Our soil structure analog system greatly altered microbial expression profiles compared to the liquid-only incubations, emphasizing the importance of incorporating environmental parameters, like pores and surfaces, for understanding microbial phenotypes relevant to soil ecosystems. These changes were mainly driven by differences in overall expression of chitin-degrading Streptomyces species and stress-tolerant Ensifer. Our findings suggest that the success of Ensifer in a structured environment is likely related to its ability to repurpose carbon via the glyoxylate shunt while potentially using polyhydroxyalkanoate granules as a C source. We also identified traits like motility, stress resistance, and biofilm formation that underlie the degradation of chitin across our treatments and inform how they may ultimately alter carbon use efficiency. Together our results demonstrate that community functions like decomposition are sensitive to environmental conditions and more complex than the multi-enzyme pathways involved in depolymerization.\n\nImportanceSoil moisture and porosity are critical mediators of microbial metabolism by influencing factors such as redox conditions, substrate availability, and soil connectivity. However, identifying how microbial community metabolism shifts in response to varying levels of moisture and porosity remains a challenging frontier. This difficulty arises from challenges in accurately representing the soil environment and in establishing tractable microbial communities that limit confounding variables. Moreover, inferring phenotypes based on \"key\" genes often fails to predict complex phenotypes that arise from cellular interactions. Here, we establish a tractably complex microbial community in a soil analog system amended with chitin and leverage it to understand how microorganisms respond to changes in porosity and moisture.

Yet, bias per se might not be a methodological issue as soon as its statistical distribution in the samples is even, quantifiable, and thus correctable in quantitative analyses. In this study, we focus on avian predation of lepidopteran larvae models, which represent one of the most widespread predator-prey interactions in various ecosystems worldwide. We compared bird predation on plasticine caterpillar models to that on dead caterpillars of similar size and color, using camera traps and observer posterior assessment to identify biases and quantify actual predation events. Although camera trap analyses revealed that birds respond similarly to plasticine models and dead caterpillars, suggesting no advantage in using dead prey for assessing avian predation, the results of posterior identification of predation marks showed contradictory results, making the interpretation of the results ambiguous. Observer inconsistencies in detecting predation clues on models highlight potential biases, with camera trap data showing these clues do not reliably indicate actual bird predation.

However, the evolutionary origins of its complex interactions and functional diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of MAPK components across Eukarya to delineate divergences of non-human orthologs of human paralogs along the human evolutionary backbone. We identified two major pulses of coevolutionary expansion: one predating the divergence of fungi and animals, and another predating the origin of animals. Our reconstruction also infers a polyphyletic origin for the atypical MAPKs. Integrating functional literature across eukaryotic taxa with our reconstructed trees reveals that the two clades of MAP3K, Sterile-like (STE) and tyrosine kinase-like (TKL), had distinct evolutionary trajectories and influences on downstream pathway diversification. STEs that function as MAP3Ks are conserved across extant eukaryotes. Despite the absence of TKL MAP3Ks in many early diverging eukaryotes, the expansion of TKL MAP3Ks aligns phylogenetically and functionally with that of the downstream MAP2Ks and MAPKs. We thus propose that the MAPK network originated as a STE-regulated pathway, and that subsequent radiations of the TKLs drove the diversification of downstream components and top-down finetuning of pathway specificity. We thus provide an evolutionary framework for generating novel hypotheses on the functional diversity of this key signaling network, including potential insights into the evolution of animal multicellularity. Our study demonstrates that phylogenetics can offer new perspectives towards understanding complex cellular physiology.\n\nSignificanceThe mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling network responds to various signals and regulates basic cell physiology including proliferation and apoptosis. This three-tier network is universal in eukaryotes, but there is great functional diversity among different homologs as well as different taxa.

We tested narrowband blue, green, and red spectra, three ratios of red and blue light, and a spectrum combining all three colors across a gradient of light intensity in microcosms. Orius insidiosus was active and successfully attacked prey under all lighting conditions, with 70% of individuals engaging in predation during the observation period. The light spectrum significantly influenced all recorded behaviors, while light intensity had negligible effects. Narrowband spectra led to the highest attack probabilities, but the mixed blue-red spectrum with a higher proportion of red light yielded the highest prey capture rates. The spectrum with all three colors showed intermediate capture success. These trends were consistent regarding capture probability in more complex environments with cucumber plants, where thrips were exposed to 24-hour artificial light sequences before and during predator releases. However, thrips survival rates remained similar across all lighting treatments.

Here, we hypothesized that unrestricted access is necessary for mice to overeat high-fat diets, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diets would reduce food intake and weight gain in a high-fat diet model of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized home-cage based feeding devices that either provided food freely or required mice to briefly poke their noses into a port - a simple action that is easy for them to do - to receive food. With both low-fat and high-fat diets, requiring mice to nose-poke just one time to access food strongly reduced food intake, and in the case of high-fat diet prevented the development of obesity. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating in mice, and that making mice perform a simple action such as a nose-poke to access food reduces over-eating and weight gain.

Current anti-estrogen therapies, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, have limitations, including partial agonist activity and resistance development, which evidence the need for more potent alternatives. Endoxifen, a metabolite of tamoxifen, has emerged as a promising breast cancer therapeutic candidate due to its superior anti-estrogenic effects and side effect profile. The omics signatures for endoxifen, tamoxifen and fulvestrant, obtained from publicly available datasets, were aggregated and harmonized by means of the PandaOmics platform, a commercially available target-discovery platform using multiple AI engines including generative pretrained transformers. Pathway enrichment analyses provided insight into these agents mechanisms of action (MOA) in breast cancer. The analyses revealed unexpected variances in several key pathways from expected interactions via estrogen-dependent and independent effects. All three drugs downregulated estrogen signaling and cell cycle-related pathways, such as E2F targets, G2-M checkpoints, Myc targets, and mitotic spindle, and stimulated apoptosis. Fulvestrant and tamoxifen activated pro-inflammatory and immune pathways and perturbed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Endoxifen perturbed the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway, pursuant to distinct molecular mechanisms compared to its parent compound, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant. In summary, advanced AI-driven methodologies demonstrate the capacity to analyze multi-omics data in a comparative way to advance the understanding of endocrine therapy mechanisms in breast cancer. This insight into the distinct effects of endoxifen, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant may aid in selecting the most effective therapies for specific indications and in identifying drug-specific biomarkers.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.615935", "title": "Efficacy of photodynamic therapy using 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced photosensitization is enhanced in pancreatic cancer cells with acquired drug resistance", "authors": "Liu, Y.; Mensah, S.

In monolayer and 3D culture dose response studies the Panc1OR cells exhibit significantly higher cell killing at lower light doses than the drug naive cells. Panc1OR also exhibits increased PpIX accumulation.

Additional investigation using exogenous delivery of PpIX also shows higher cell killing in drug resistant cells, under conditions which achieve approximately the same intracellular PpIX.

Selectively targeting LT{beta}R nonclassical NF{kappa}B pathways on both tumors and LECs cocultured with Tregs, inhibited tumor growth and migration in vitro.

Our previous studies demonstrated that HER2 interacts with the calcium pump, PMCA2, and the scaffolding molecules, NHERF1 and Ezrin to stabilize HER2/HSP90 interactions and contribute to the retention of active HER2 at the plasma membrane. In the normal mammary epithelium where apical/basal polarity is tightly regulated by junctional proteins, HER2 is expressed at the basolateral membrane and interacts with the LAP family member, Erbin, whereas PMCA2, NHERF1, and Ezrin localize to the apical membrane. Here, we show that loss of apical membrane polarity in hyperplastic lesions of MMTV-Neu mammary glands or in human DCIS leads to intermixing of these molecules and allows Erbin to interact with NHERF1, Ezrin and HER2 initially within the basolateral membrane and then more diffusely within the plasma membrane. In SKBR3 cells, Erbin physically interacts with NHERF1, Ezrin and HER2 in actin-rich membrane protrusions that we have previously described to be sites of active HER2 signaling. Knockdown of Erbin in these cells reduced HER2 signaling by disrupting the formation of a HER2/NHERF1/Ezrin/HSP90 protein complex in the membrane protrusions. Furthermore, inhibition of Ezrin or knock-down of NHERF1 expression disrupted the ability of Erbin to interact with HER2. Taken together, our data suggest that Erbin supports HER2 stability, HER2 membrane retention and HER2 transforming ability by interacting with Ezrin and NHERF1 to maintain a multi-protein signaling complex necessary for HER2-mediated transformation.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616183", "title": "Potent and durable gene modulation in heart and muscle with chemically defined siRNAs", "authors": "Fakih, H.

Recent advances in delivery strategies to muscle include conjugation of biologics (antibody/antibody fragments, peptides), which are currently in clinical development. However, the manufacturing of biologic-siRNA conjugates is a challenging and complex process. By contrast, lipophilic siRNAs are readily chemically synthesized at scale and support sufficient cardiac and skeletal muscle delivery. In this work, we refine siRNA design elements to enhance potency and durability and support clinically relevant silencing in muscle. Applying this strategy for siRNAs targeting myostatin (MSTN), a key target in muscle-wasting conditions, we show that a single subcutaneous dose in mice achieved robust and durable silencing ([~]80% inhibition up to 6 weeks, [~]30% at 14 weeks). Biweekly dosing resulted in >95% reduction of circulating MSTN for half a year, with no observed systemic or target-related toxicity. MSTN inhibition resulted in muscle growth and increased lean muscle mass, correlating with improved grip strength. Interestingly, the functional impact on muscle growth and strength significantly outlasts the target silencing, suggesting extended pharmacological effects. Systemic administration was equally efficacious in all muscle groups tested, including skeletal muscle, heart, tongue and diaphragm. The informational nature of the muscle-active chemically defined siRNA scaffold was confirmed by demonstrating muscle and heart efficacy with three additional targets.

In virtue of the symbiosis with the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Trichormus azollae, Azolla spp. are ferns that release nitrogen into the environment upon decomposition of their biomass. However, if and to what extent actively growing Azolla plants impact on the development of co-cultivated rice plantlets remains to be understood. Here, we show that actively growing Azolla filiculoides plants alter the architecture of the roots and accelerates the differentiation and proliferation of leaves and tillers in co-cultivated rice plants. These changes result from an intimate cross-talk between rice and A. filiculoides, in which hormones and other metabolites released by the fern in the growth medium trigger an alteration in the rice root transcriptome and the hormonal profiles of both roots and leaves.

A common way to study a plasticity programme is to track the underlying molecular changes over time, by collecting omics time-series data.

Here we report a new mathematical framework that models cell plasticity as a multi-step completion process, where the system moves from the initial state along a path guided by multiple intermediate attractors until the final state (i.e. a new homeostasis) is reached. In benchmarking tests, we show that our developed Control Point (CP) model fits omics time-series data and identifies attractor states that are well-aligned with prior knowledge.

Infested flour exhibited reductions in total soluble sugars, triacylglycerol levels, and unsaturated fatty acids, particularly Oleic and Linoleic acid, while secondary metabolites such as phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins were increased. Behavioural assays revealed that adult beetles were significantly more attracted towards infested flour odour due to the presence of 4,8-Dimethyldecanal (4,8-DMD), an aggregation pheromone of T. castaneum. Another key compound in infested flour, 1-Pentadecene, derived from the beetles cuticular wax, was found to influence adult beetle behaviour. At higher concentrations, 1-Pentadecene acted as a repellent for the species. Molecular docking studies suggested that 1-Pentadecene competes with 4,8-DMD for binding to the odorant receptor TcOR1, which could potentially inhibit aggregation behaviour and reduce population growth. The docking analysis revealed that 1-Pentadecene interacts with the same binding pocket on TcOR1, sharing key amino acids (MET49, PHE69, THR72, GLN73, THR134, VAL135, TYR138, LEU154, ILE177, GLY180, ALA181, TYR286) and forming similar intermolecular bonds, such as a pi-alkyl bond, with a binding affinity ({Delta}G = -5.7) comparable to 4,8-DMD ({Delta}G = -5.8).

Cultured primary neurons provide a key complementary tool for such studies, but existing protocols for culturing embryonic zebrafish primary neurons are limited by short cell survival and low neuronal purity. In this study, we set out to establish a protocol to produce long lived, pure neuronal cultures from zebrafish that could be used to study the mechanistic contributions of genes to neuronal networks. We then used these primary cultures to characterize cell proliferation and differentiation in primary neurons derived from scn1lab mutant embryos, which lack a sodium channel relevant to Dravet syndrome and autism. Using our optimized protocol, we generated cultures that proliferate, diversify, and form stable networks of neurons surviving for months. These stable cultures allowed us to perform genetic experiments, in this case revealing dramatic differences in the cellular composition of cultures derived from scn1lab mutant embryos versus their wild type siblings. Specifically, we find that loss of scn1lab promotes hyperproliferation of non-neuronal cells in mixed cultures of brain cells. In pure neuronal cultures, we find alterations in neurotransmitter subtypes consistent with known effects of scn1lab loss of function. Validating the utility of this approach, we then identify a corresponding hyperproliferation phenotype in live scn1lab mutant embryos, shedding light on potential mechanisms that may be relevant for Dravet syndrome.\n\nSignificance statementMost existing embryonic zebrafish primary neuron culture protocols describe growing mixed cell types for restricted durations.

Research has highlighted the crucial role of gut microbiota in overall health, including cognition and neurodegenerative disorders. Cancer patients receiving pelvic radiation often experience gut dysbiosis and this may induce changes in brain through the bi-directional connection between the gut microbiota and the brain, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Bacterial supplements intended to enhance health, whether consumed orally or applied topically. However, the mechanism of bacterial supplements to mitigate pelvic radiation-induced metabolomic alterations is not understood. To investigate this, we employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate how these supplements might mitigate radiation-induced metabolomic changes in the rat brain. A single 6 Gy dose of pelvic radiation was administered to 3-4-month-old Sprague Dawley rats and formulated bacterial supplements were given accordingly. Faecal bacterial sequencing and brain metabolomics performed to identify the changes in the gut microbiota and brain metabolomic analysis to check the altered brain metabolites post pelvic radiation. High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing revealed significant shifts in bacterial composition, with reduced diversity in the radiation group compared to controls, which was restored in the supplementation groups. Notably, the dominant genera in the radiation group included Methanobrevibacter, while Parasutterella and Brachyspira were prevalent in the supplementation cohorts. Untargeted metabolomic analysis identified 2,554 annotated metabolites, with 56 showing significant differences across groups. Principal Component Analysis demonstrated distinct metabolomic profiles between irradiated and control groups, with specific metabolomic pathways like retinol and glycerophospholipid metabolism altered by irradiation. Bacterial supplementation significantly attenuated these metabolomic disruptions. Therefore, bacterial supplementation could be a promising approach to addressing radiation-induced metabolomic reprogramming in the brains through gut dysbiosis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy, enhancing overall well-being.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616229", "title": "Dysfunctional LHX6 pallido-subthalamic projections mediate epileptic events in a mouse model of Leigh Syndrome", "authors": "Sanchez-Benito, L.; Compte, J.; Vila, M.; Sanz, E.; Quintana, A.", "author_corresponding": "Albert Quintana", "author_corresponding_institution": "Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616229.source.xml", "abstract": "Deficits in the mitochondrial energy-generating machinery cause mitochondrial disease (MD), a group of untreatable and usually fatal disorders.

For many years, riluzole was the only approved drug and it offered modest benefits. In 2017, edaravone was approved for ALS and became the first drug to be used in combination with riluzole. In the present study, we have attempted to build on the concepts of combinatorial therapy by testing novel drug combinations in a transgenic mouse model. Mice that express A315T mutant TDP43, using the mouse prion promoter, have been reported to develop many of the symptoms of ALS, including paralysis. Aberrant TDP43 function is a common feature in sporadic ALS, and thus TDP43 transgenic models may recapitulate disease processes that occur in humans with sporadic ALS. Although the PrP.TDP43-A315T model has been reported to develop abnormalities in gut motility that contribute to early mortality, recent studies indicated that gut motility issues could be mitigated by feeding mice with gel-based diets rather than the standard dry chow. In the present study, we have attempted to use the PrP.TDP43-A315T model to test whether we could identify a drug combination that synergized to extend life span in this model substantially.

Both rhythmic and broadband processes contribute to the neural power spectrum, which decomposes the variance of a neural recording across frequencies. Although an extensive body of literature has successfully studied rhythms in various diseases and brain states, researchers only recently have systematically studied the characteristics of broadband effects in the power spectrum. Broadband effects can generally be categorized as 1) shifts in power across all frequencies, which correlate with changes in local firing rates and 2) changes in the overall shape of the power spectrum, such as the spectral slope or power law exponent. Shape changes are evident in various conditions and brain states, influenced by factors such as excitation to inhibition balance, age, and various diseases. It is increasingly recognized that broadband and rhythmic effects can interact on a sub-second timescale. For example, broadband power is time-locked to the phase of <1 Hz rhythms in propofol induced unconsciousness. Modeling tools that explicitly deal with both rhythmic and broadband contributors to the power spectrum and that capture their interactions are essential to help improve the interpretability of power spectral effects. Here, we introduce a tractable stochastic forward modeling framework designed to capture both narrowband and broadband spectral effects when prior knowledge or theory about the primary biophysical processes involved is available. Population-level neural recordings are modeled as the sum of filtered point processes (FPPs), each representing the contribution of a different biophysical process such as action potentials or postsynaptic potentials of different types. Our approach builds on prior neuroscience FPP work by allowing multiple interacting processes and time-varying firing rates and by deriving theoretical power spectra and cross-spectra. We demonstrate several properties of the models, including that they divide the power spectrum into frequency ranges dominated by rhythmic and broadband effects, and that they can capture spectral effects across multiple timescales, including sub-second cross-frequency coupling. The framework can be used to interpret empirically observed power spectra and cross-frequency coupling effects in biophysical terms, which bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental results.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616107", "title": "Brainstem neurons coordinate the bladder and urethra sphincter for urination", "authors": "Li, X.; Li, X.; Li, J.; Qin, H.; Liang, S.; Li, J.; Jian, T.; Wang, X.; Yin, L.; Yuan, C.; Liao, X.; Jia, H.; Chen, X.; Yao, J.", "author_corresponding": "Xiaowei Chen", "author_corresponding_institution": "Army Medical University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.01.616107.source.xml", "abstract": "Urination, a vital and conserved process of emptying urine from the urinary bladder in mammals, requires precise coordination between the bladder and external urethra sphincter (EUS) that is tightly controlled by a complex neural network.

Survival curve approaches, such as the Cox proportional hazards model and risk scores provide a more nuanced picture of the course of infection.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, their efficacy remains limited in tumors with minimal lymphocyte infiltration. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes in TNBC.\n\nMethodsWe designed a chimeric cytokine receptor (ChCR) that triggers STAT1 signaling upon stimulation with IL-10 or TGF{beta}, cytokines prevalent in the TME that typically drive immunosuppression. Human primary macrophages were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the ChCR, and changes in their phenotype, secretome, and transcriptome were analyzed following stimulation. The anti-tumoral activity of these reprogrammed macrophages was assessed using co-culture assays with 3D TNBC spheroids.\n\nResultsChCR expressing macrophages showed robust STAT1 activation in response to IL-10 or TGF{beta} stimulation, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype similar to IFN{gamma} activation, as confirmed by phenotypic markers, and transcriptomic profiling. These ChCR-stimulated macrophages demonstrated significant anti-tumoral effects in 3D TNBC spheroids. Moreover, ChCR stimulation led to the upregulation of genes associated with good response to ICIs, among others CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines essential for lymphocyte recruitment. Secretion of CXCL10 was also confirmed by ELISA.\n\nConclusionWe successfully engineered a ChCR that reprograms TAMs within an IL-10- and TGF{beta}-rich environment, inducing an inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumoral activity.

The planarian field has made significant progress in identifying specific genes and cell types required for this complex process, but substantially less is known about the molecular mechanisms that convert a significant physical injury (e.g., head amputation) into the expression of specific genes in particular cell types. One tissue in which this question is particularly relevant is the planarian epidermis, a single-layer, mucociliary epithelium with similarities to the epithelia of mammalian airways. This epithelium plays an essential, early role in planarian regeneration as the cells surrounding the wound site must quickly stretch and extend to cover the wound area after injury. We hypothesized that these injury-induced morphological changes activate the transcription of genes with essential functions in the regenerative process. To best detect these transcriptional changes, we developed a rapid method for isolating the planarian outer epithelium and prepared ribodepleted RNA-sequencing libraries from samples isolated at multiple time points after tissue amputation. One gene we both identified using these methods and found to be functionally important for regeneration is a putative planarian homolog of vertebrate Shoc2.

These growth conditions yielded a strain with a maximum growth temperature approximately 2 {degrees}C above that of the parental strain.

Prior work has shown that Pol-I engages with components of Pol-II on rDNA, but its role in global transcription and chromatin structure beyond the nucleolus has largely been ignored. By pairing auxin-inducible degron technology with nanoscopic imaging, RNA-Seq, and Hi-C, we found that Pol-I and Pol-II co-regulate conformationally defined chromatin domains and mRNA synthesis.

Additionally, the study aims to recalibrate score thresholds to better reflect evidence of pathogenicity. Methods: ClinVar variants classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), benign (B), or likely benign (LB) were analyzed using 25 VEP tools. Tools were evaluated based on discriminatory performance. Data were stratified by variant creation date, allele frequency, conservation level, mode of inheritance (MOI), and disease category. For each subset, Bayesian methods were employed to recalibrate score thresholds corresponding to the levels of evidence defined by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Results: The performance of VEP tools varied significantly across different subsets. Variants created after 2020 showed a mild yet significant decrease in the performance of certain VEP tools, particularly those trained on earlier datasets. VEP tools exhibited reduced accuracy for variants with higher allele frequencies, particularly those exceeding a frequency of 10-4, suggesting a need for recalibration when assessing more common variants. Tools demonstrated lower discriminatory performance for variants located in regions with high conservation, mostly due to a decrease in specificity. Variants affecting autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked (XL) genes were more accurately classified compared to those affecting autosomal dominant (AD) genes by most tools. Differences in MOI and conservation levels within certain disease categories were shown to correlate with overall performance.

However, their performance can vary depending on molecular and clinical contexts, complicating variant classification. Aim: This study aims to assess the performance variability of commonly used VEP tools under different conditions. Additionally, the study aims to recalibrate score thresholds to better reflect evidence of pathogenicity. Methods: ClinVar variants classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), benign (B), or likely benign (LB) were analyzed using 25 VEP tools. Tools were evaluated based on discriminatory performance. Data were stratified by variant creation date, allele frequency, conservation level, mode of inheritance (MOI), and disease category. For each subset, Bayesian methods were employed to recalibrate score thresholds corresponding to the levels of evidence defined by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Results: The performance of VEP tools varied significantly across different subsets. Variants created after 2020 showed a mild yet significant decrease in the performance of certain VEP tools, particularly those trained on earlier datasets. VEP tools exhibited reduced accuracy for variants with higher allele frequencies, particularly those exceeding a frequency of 10-4, suggesting a need for recalibration when assessing more common variants. Tools demonstrated lower discriminatory performance for variants located in regions with high conservation, mostly due to a decrease in specificity. Variants affecting autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked (XL) genes were more accurately classified compared to those affecting autosomal dominant (AD) genes by most tools. Differences in MOI and conservation levels within certain disease categories were shown to correlate with overall performance. Recalibration of prediction scores resulted in lower score thresholds in low conservation regions compared to high and uncovered subsets in which higher levels of evidence may be achieved.

Mutations in KCNJ2 have been linked to several clinical phenotypes associated with ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death including Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) related to loss of function mutations and Short QT Syndrome 3 related to gain of function mutations. Detailed structural-functional relationships to explain the arrhythmia phenotypes are understudied and limit the capacity to provide precision medicine. Here, we combine in-depth and complementary computational molecular modeling techniques with functional analysis from three patients with ATS that harbor KCNJ2 mutations R67Q, R218L, and G300D. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments revealed loss of function in homomeric mutant channels. Full-length Kir2.1 models were developed for structure-based investigation, and mutations were introduced in both open and closed conformations. Site-directed mutagenesis identified altered interaction profiles contributing to structural perturbations. Molecular dynamics simulations assessed the impact of each mutation on overall channel conformation and stability. Principal component analysis and normal mode analysis revealed mutation-specific structural perturbations. These findings extend beyond previous studies, offering atomic-level characterization of mutation-specific perturbations. Our multifaceted approach provides first atomic-level insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ATS, paving the way for targeted therapeutic strategies.\n\nStudy Highlights1) Clinical mutation analysis confirmed loss-of-function.\n\n2) Mutation analysis revealed that these clinical mutations dramatically alter the interaction pattern of the mutated residue and subsequently disturbs channel stability.\n\n3) The molecular dynamics based RMSD and RMSF evaluations show that the open conformation state of the channel is more stable comparative to the closed state however, the mutations impact channel conformations regardless of conductance state.\n\n4) The PCA (principal component analysis) and PCA based NM (normal mode) analysis revealed that these clinical KCNJ2 mutations caused significant conformational changes, even distant from the specific residue.\n\n4) This study is the first extensive in silico and experimental analysis of KCNJ2 clinical mutations that start from the arrhythmia phenotype and lead to an in-depth atomic-level investigation.

Furthermore, it exhibits significant health disparities that affect African-American (AA) men more adversely than others do. Previously, we established CYP3A5, a highly expressed protein in AAs PC, as a positive regulator of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. We examined the impact of CYP3A5 depletion on genome-wide transcriptional output using RNA sequencing to gain deeper mechanistic insights. The data revealed that 561 genes were downregulated and 263 were upregulated upon silencing of CYP3A5 in PC cells. Furthermore, in silico pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes suggested that the cell cycle regulation pathway was most significantly affected by CYP3A5 inhibition. Cell cycle analysis of CYP3A5-silenced cells and those treated with clobetasol, a specific CYP3A5 pharmacological inhibitor, showed G1/S phase blockade. Both CYP3A5-depletion and pharmacological inhibition resulted in the downregulation of cyclin D, cyclin B, and CDK2, along with the upregulation of p27kip1 but had minimal effects on CDK4/6 levels. Combination treatment with clobetasol and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib exhibited synergy with combination index (CI) values ranging from 0.28-0.78. Our findings support the utility of CYP3A5 as a druggable therapeutic target that works more effectively in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition to limit the progression of PC, especially for AA patients with AA. This combination addresses CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance, which is often linked to CDK2 overexpression, and can potentially be useful in reducing disparities in the clinical outcomes of PC.\n\nSignificanceOur study highlights CYP3A5 as a key regulator of the cell cycle in prostate cancer (PC). Its overexpression in African American (AA) patients may be a key molecular driver of disparities in outcomes. The combination of CYP3A5 and CDK4/6 inhibitors shows a synergistic effect on therapeutic outcomes and addresses CDK2-mediated resistance.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have demonstrated an important role for BRCA-mutant patients with early TNBC. Combination approaches with PARPi can broaden the use of PARPi to a larger cohort of TNBC patients. We selected six genes from our previously identified 63-gene signature that was associated with PARPi response. siFEN1 increased cells in G2/M arrest, DNA damage and particularly apoptosis. Targeting FEN1 with a chemical inhibitor enhanced the efficacy of PARPi in 7/10 cell lines, and synergy was demonstrated mainly in PARPi-resistant TNBC cell lines. A BRCA2-mutant cell line with acquired resistance to olaparib (HCC1395-OlaR) was strongly synergistic, with a combination index value of 0.20. The combination of PARPi and FEN1 inhibition also showed synergy in a PARPi-resistant xenograft-derived organoid model. Two mechanisms which explain the underlying efficacy are rapid progression in DNA replication fork speed and enhancement of DNA damage. The combination induced the highest fork speed (47% difference in comparison to control, P<0.0001) when FEN1 inhibition and PARPi equally increased fork speed individually in a cell line with a pre-existing increase in replication stress. The combination also increased DNA damage at lower drug concentrations, driving response in most of the synergistic cell lines. Gene expression analysis suggested that the sensitizing role of FEN1 inhibition in PARPi-resistant cell lines may be due to downregulation of pathways including mismatch repair.

While Ca2+ sensitization explains diastolic dysfunction, the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias is unresolved. Here, we show that HCM mutations or pharmacological interventions that increase myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity generate bioenergetic mismatch and oxidative stress during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation which provide a trigger and a substrate for arrhythmias. For any given sarcomere shortening that produces work and consumes ATP, less Ca2+ stimulates the Krebs cycle to maintain mitochondrial NADH. This reverses the mitochondrial transhydrogenase to regenerate NADH from NADPH, supporting ATP production at the cost of NADPH-dependent antioxidative capacity. The ensuing overflow of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria and glutathione oxidation induce spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ waves, well-defined triggers of arrhythmias. Furthermore, transhydrogenase-dependent ROS formation slows electrical conduction during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation in vivo, providing a substrate for arrhythmias. Chronic treatment with a mitochondrially-targeted ROS scavenger abolishes the arrhythmic burden during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation in HCM mice in vivo, while inducing mitochondrial ROS with a redox cycler is sufficient to induce arrhythmias in wild-type animals.

Yet, this requires estimating the phase of a rhythm at the edge of the epoch. This is challenging, because any phase estimation that is spectrally specific requires a finite window length often combined with tapers that de-emphasize the signal close to the edge. To overcome this, we propose a method that builds on previously described approaches based on autoregressive modeling of the data and corresponding extrapolation beyond the edge. In contrast to related previous approaches, the modeling is based on the broadband signals, avoiding filtering-related group delays, and the extrapolation is performed multiple times, allowing averaging and thereby the reduction of extrapolation noise. The new method provided more accurate phase estimation at the edge for most simulated datasets, and for an empirical dataset from awake macaque area V4.

Male and female networks were subjected to hypoxic conditions, followed by a recovery phase, with or without exogenous estrogen treatment. Electrophysiological activity, including spikes and bursts, was monitored and analyzed. Apoptosis was assessed through immunocytochemistry, focusing on caspase-dependent and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF)-dependent pathways.\n\nResultsUnder hypoxic conditions, male and female neuronal networks exhibited a similar decrease in firing and network burst rates, with an associated increase in network burst durations. Estrogen treatment altered these dynamics, leading to increased network burst rates and decreased network burst duration for both sexes.

Unfortunately, poor compliance hinders the success of this approach. A proposed alternative is resveratrol (Rsv), a CR-mimetic known to promote brain health. Direct comparison between the effects of Rsv and CR on brain health is lacking, with limited knowledge on their sex-specific effects. Therefore, we aimed to compare and unravel the sex-specific impact of these dietary interventions on spontaneous brain activity.\n\nMethodsHere, we used resting-state fMRI to investigate functional connectivity (FC) changes in five prominent resting-state brain networks (RSNs) in healthy four month old male and female F344 rats supplemented to either 40% CR or daily Rsv supplementation (10 mg/kg, oral) for the duration of one month.\n\nResultsOur results demonstrated a decreased body weight (BW) in CR rats, as well as an increase in body weight in male Rsv supplemented rats, compared to female Rsv supplemented rats, whereas this difference between sexes was not observed in the control or CR groups. Furthermore, we found that both CR or Rsv supplementation induce a female-specific decrease of FC between the subcortical network and hippocampal network, and between the subcortical network and lateral cortical network. Moreover, Rsv supplementation lowered FC within the hippocampal network and between the hippocampal and the default mode like network, the lateral cortical network and the sensory network - an effect not observed for the CR rats. Finally, we observed an overall lower FC in male rats compared to females, irrespective of dietary intervention, within the subcortical network and between the subcortical, the sensory and default mode like network.\n\nDiscussionOur findings reveal that both CR and Rsv induce a similar female-specific decrease of FC in RSNs associated with memory and emotion, all the while CR and Rsv induce dissimilar changes in body weight and other within- and between RSN FC measures. Altogether, this study provides insight into the effects and comparability of short-term CR and Rsv supplementation on brain connectivity within and between RSNs in both male and female F344 rats, providing a FC reference for future research of dietary effects.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616293", "title": "Immunotherapy with nebulized pattern recognition receptor agonists restores severe immune paralysis and improves outcomes in mice with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis", "authors": "Garcia, J.

Previously, desensitization of pattern recognition pathways has been described as a hallmark of IAPA pathogenesis and predictor of mortality in IAPA patients. Therefore, we studied the impact of nebulized Toll-like receptor 2/6/9 agonists Pam2 CSK4 (Pam2) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) on infection outcomes and pulmonary immunopathology in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed murine IAPA model. Mice with IAPA receiving mock therapy showed rapidly progressing disease and a paralyzed immune response to secondary A. fumigatus infection. Nebulized Pam2ODN was well tolerated and significantly prolonged event-free survival. Specifically, dual-dose Pam2ODN therapy before and after A. fumigatus infection led to 81% survival and full recovery of all survivors. Additionally, transcriptional analysis of lung tissue homogenates revealed induction of PRR signaling and several key effector cytokine pathways after Pam2ODN therapy. Moreover, transcriptional and flow cytometric analyses suggested enhanced recruitment of macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells in Pam2ODN-treated mice. Collectively, immunomodulatory treatment with nebulized Pam2ODN strongly improved morbidity and mortality outcomes and alleviated paralyzed antifungal immunity in an otherwise lethal IAPA model.

Robust tissue size control implies the existence of compensatory mechanisms that allow developing systems to recover from growth perturbations. However, the difficulty of directly observing normal or compensatory developmental growth means we have little understanding of the cellular behaviours that confer robustness to tissue size control. Here, we study how growth perturbations affect proliferation kinetics and the timing of growth termination of Drosophila histoblasts, the progenitors that give rise to the adult abdominal epidermis. Histoblasts undergo extensive growth and proliferation during the pupal stage, which is accessible for long-term live-imaging and precise quantitative analysis. By manipulating cell number or volume prior to the pupal growth phase, we changed the starting size of the abdomen primordium, then observed how the histoblasts adapted to these changes by altering their growth dynamics. We show that, upon a decrease in starting tissue size, the histoblasts compensate by extending their temporal proliferative window, undergoing additional cell cycles, as well as increasing their apical area to maximise coverage of the abdominal surface. When initial tissue size is increased, the histoblasts undergo fewer division cycles and arrest proliferation earlier than normal. Thus, the proliferative window of this tissue is flexible enough to buffer for changes in tissue size. Our data also suggest that the histoblasts sense both spatial and temporal cues to arrest their growth at the appropriate time and ensure accurate tissue size control.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616385", "title": "Tissue-specific transcriptomics uncovers novel craniofacial genes underlying jaw divergence in specialist pupfishes", "authors": "Palominos, M.

Here we introduce four near-complete genomic assemblies of viruses that infect the widespread marine picoeukaryote Micromonas commoda, doubling the number of published genomes of Micromonas dsDNA viruses. All host and virus isolates were obtained from tropical waters of the North Pacific, a first for viruses infecting green algae in the order Mamiellales. Genome length of the new isolates ranges from 205-212 kb, and phylogenetic analysis shows that all four are members of the genus Prasinovirus. Three of the viruses form a clade that is adjacent to previously sequenced Micromonas viruses, while the fourth virus is relatively divergent from previously sequenced prasinoviruses. We identified 61 putative genes not previously found in prasinoviruses, including a phosphate transporter from a family novel to viruses, and a potential apoptosis inhibitor novel to marine viruses. Forty-eight genes in the new viruses are also found in host genome(s) and may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. By analyzing the coding sequences of all published prasinoviruses we found that [~]25% of prasinovirus gene content is significantly correlated with host genus identity (i.e., Micromonas, Ostreococcus, or Bathycoccus), and the functions of these genes suggest that much of the viral life cycle is differentially adapted to the three host genera.

Comparing isolates from the same location demonstrates high genomic diversity among viruses that co-occur and presumably compete for hosts.

For the development of effective prevention strategies in high-risk patients, we aimed to better understand the roles of inflammatory pathways and the tumour microenvironment as the main driver of progression to malignancy in HPV-infected tissues. We analysed the spatial organisation of seven samples of HPV+ high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3), comparing tumour heterogeneity and immune microenvironments between pre-malignant (neoplastic) and adjacent cervical tissues. We observed evidence of immune suppression within the neoplastic regions across all samples and identified distinct immune clusters for each dysplastic lesion. Previous single-cell data analyses in an HPV16 E7 oncoprotein-driven transgenic mouse model suggested a potential role for IL34-CSF1R signalling in immune modulation, where low IL34 expression was associated with Langerhans cell dysfunction, and, in cervical cancer, with poor patient outcome. Here, we observed that IL34-CSF1R co-expression was absent within HPV-associated neoplastic tissues but present in adjacent normal tissue regions. Additionally, we identified enrichment of an M2 gene signature in neoplastic tissue, while adjacent tissue was enriched with a pro-inflammatory M1 gene signature.

Here we briefly exposed female Bicyclus anynana butterflies to wild type (Wt) and modified male sex pheromone blends, previously shown to modify females sexual preferences, and examined how their brains were modified at the morphological and molecular levels, three days later. First, we 3D-reconstructed male and female brains of this species and documented sexual dimorphism in the size of seven of 67 glomeruli present in the olfactory lobe. Then we showed that several glomeruli changed in volume after blend exposures, implicating them in sex pheromone perception. Finally, we found that a few genes were differentially expressed but many more were differentially spliced between male and female naive brains, and between naive and pheromone blend-exposed brains. These are primarily calcium-binding channels and RNA-binding genes, respectively. A learned preference for changed levels in a single pheromone component was linked to variants of proteins involved in synaptic transmission. Our work shows that naive male and female brains differ primarily in gene splicing patterns and that a brief, 3-minute, exposure to pheromones produces slight changes in brain volume and large changes in the splicing of genes involved in neural development, that correlate with changes in sexual preferences in females.\n\nSignificance statementHow brains differ between the sexes and respond to sex-specific cues is a hot research topic. Here we investigate how the brains of female butterflies differ from those of males and respond to male sex pheromones. We find that the sexes differ in the volume of a sub-set of olfactory lobe glomeruli, and the volume of some glomeruli also changes after exposure to pheromone blends. In addition, male and female brains differ primarily in hundreds of splice variants, both before and after pheromone exposure. These findings suggest that different proteins (splice variants) characterize male and female brains and that a brief exposure to pheromones can lead to changes in brain structure and in further gene splicing linked to altered sexual preferences in female butterflies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616310", "title": "Divergent changes in social stress-induced motivation in male and female mice", "authors": "McGraw, M.; Christensen, C.; Nelson, H.; Li, A.-J.; Qualls-Creekmore, E.", "author_corresponding": "Emily Qualls-Creekmore", "author_corresponding_institution": "Washington State University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "animal behavior and cognition", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616310.source.xml", "abstract": "Exposure to stressors has been shown to dysregulate motivated behaviors in a bidirectional manner over time. The relationship between stress and motivation is relevant to psychological disorders, including depression, binge eating, and substance abuse; however, this relationship is not well characterized, especially in females, despite their increased risk of these disorders. Social defeat stress is a common model to study stress-induced motivation changes, however, historically this model excluded females due to lack of female-to-female aggression and unreliable male-to-female aggression. Additionally, changes in motivation are often assessed well after stress exposure ends, potentially missing or occluding changes to motivation during stress. Recently, the chronic non-discriminatory social defeat stress (CNSDS) model has demonstrated social defeat of male and female C57BL/6J mice by exposing both mice to an aggressive male CD-1 mouse simultaneously. Here we use this model to directly compare changes in the motivated behavior of male and female mice during and following chronic stress. We hypothesized that motivated behavioral responses would be dysregulated during stress and that the effects would worsen as the stress exposure continued. To monitor motivated behavior, mice had access to a Feeding Experimental Device.3 (FED3), a home cage device for operant responding. Operant responding was monitored prior to, during, and after stress by measuring nose pokes for sucrose pellets on a modified progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Our results demonstrated divergent behavioral outcomes between males and female mice in response to stress; where male mice increased motivated behavior during stress only, whereas female mice exhibited a decrease in motivation during and after stress. This study highlights the need to investigate the effects of stress-induced motivation over time, as well as the increased need to understand differences in the stress response in females.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOperant behaviors were monitored continuously during and after stress exposure.\nC_LIO_LIChronic social stress produced opposite effects on motivation in males and females.\nC_LIO_LISusceptibility to stress only influenced outcomes on female motivated behaviors.\nC_LI", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.611680", "title": "PIRATE: Plundering AlphaFold Predictions to Automate Protein Engineering", "authors": "Richardson, G.; Kopec, J.; Esposito, C.; James, T.", "author_corresponding": "Graham Richardson", "author_corresponding_institution": "Evotec US, 303 B College Road East, Princeton, N.J., U.S.A", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "biochemistry", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.611680.source.xml", "abstract": "An important characteristic for many proteins is the presence of flexible loops or linkers known as intrinsically disordered regions.

Additionally, many exoskeletons are designed for a specific utility (e.g., ankle plantarflexor assistance) and are confined to the laboratory environment, limiting the flexibility of the designed system to adapt to answer new questions and explore new domains. To address these barriers, we present OpenExo, an open-source modular untethered exoskeleton framework that provides access to all aspects of the design process including (1) software, (2) electronics, (3) hardware, and (4) control schemes. To demonstrate the utility of this exoskeleton framework, we performed benchtop and experimental validation testing with the system across multiple configurations including (1) hip-only incline assistance, (2) ankle-only indoor and outdoor assistance, (3) hip-and-ankle load-carriage assistance, and (4) elbow-only weightlifting assistance. All aspects of the software architecture, electrical components, hip and Bowden-cable transmission designs, and control schemes are freely available for other researchers to access, use, and modify when looking to address research questions in the field of wearable exoskeletons.

The need for tunable and consistent media has thus encouraged development of chemically defined media (CDM). However, CDM development strategies are rarely comprehensive nor considerate of a mediums impact on MSC therapeutic function. Standard practice often neglects high-level interactions of media components, such as growth factors, that are critical to MSC growth and function. Given that MSC morphology has been shown to predict their immunomodulatory function, we employed a high throughput screening (HTS) approach to elucidate effects of growth factor compositions on MSC phenotype and proliferation in a custom CDM.

However, establishing a causal relationship between neural signals and behavior is difficult. By defining a mathematical mapping between neural spiking activity and behavior, we investigate the role of spiking variability in adaptation during a brain-computer interface (BCI) behavior in male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta, n=2). Recent BCI evidence demonstrates that creating novel neural patterns is harder than repurposing existing patterns to respond to changes in external input. However, what limits the ability to repurpose, or adapt, patterns under different magnitudes of change is less well-characterized. Here, we present evidence that variance in neural spiking activity reveals differences in learnability between easy and hard adaptation conditions and across sessions. Furthermore, our study illuminates the limitations in neural changes underlying behavior within a neurofeedback paradigm.\n\nSignificance StatementVariability in neural activity is a major driver of behavioral variability, though it is unclear how variability is balanced with stable neural activity as new behaviors become more practiced. By using a brain-computer interface methodology, we define a mathematical mapping between neural spiking activity and a behavioral control signal. Through thoughtful manipulation of this mapping, we incite the subjects (rhesus macaques) to learn and adapt neural activity to regain behavioral proficiency. We find that metrics of neural population variability are differentially modulated depending on difficulty of the imposed manipulation.

Microchannels are cut out of the existing microplate structure and ports are drilled into the bottom of the wells to interface the wells. To test versatility and benchmark to another rapid-prototyping approach, we manufactured common microfluidic features into microplates using four different CNC mills as well as a 3D printer. Cell viability was assessed for polystyrene (PS) well plates and two 3D printed resins (MED610 and VeroClear) with the PS showing >2.5-fold increase in cell growth after three days. Machines were tested on their ability to create common device features including a traditional microfluidic device as well as a custom design incorporating complex geometries. Features were measured by confocal microscopy. We found that features including 1000{micro}m ports, 800{micro}m microchannels, 200{micro}m phase-guides, and 500{micro}m post arrays were machined and the range of CVs for features were 1.02-4.42, 1.32-3.50, 2.34-16.58, 6.25-16.40 respectively, while the 3D printed features exhibited maximal CVs of 20.98, 11.68, 23.60, and 10.01 for the same features.

Ex-zd encompasses both a lossless compression method, which modestly outperforms all current methods for nanopore signal data compression, and a  lossy method, which can be used to achieve dramatic additional savings. The latter component works by reducing the number of bits used to encode signal data.

However, the impact of data curation on ML model performance is underexplored. As more sequence and structural data become available, a datacentric approach is increasingly favored over a model-centric method. A data-centric approach prioritizes high-quality, domain-specific data, ensuring ML tools are trained on datasets that accurately reflect biological complexity and diversity. This paper introduces a novel methodology that integrates ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) into ML models, enhancing data-centric strategies in the field. ASR uses computational techniques to infer ancient protein sequences from modern descendants, providing diverse, stable sequences with rich evolutionary information. While multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are commonly used in protein engineering frameworks to incorporate evolutionary information, ASR offers deeper insights into protein evolution. Unlike MSAs, ASR captures mutation rates, phylogenic relationships, evolutionary trajectories, and specific ancestral sequences, giving access to novel protein sequences beyond what is available in public databases by natural selection. We employed two statistical methods for ASR: joint Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood. Bayesian approaches infer ancestral sequences by sampling from the entire posterior distribution, accounting for epistatic interactions between multiple amino acid positions to capture the nuances and uncertainties of ancestral sequences. In contrast, maximum likelihood methods estimate the most probable amino acids at individual positions in isolation. Both methods provide extensive ancestral data, enhancing ML model performance in protein sequence generation and fitness prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that generative ML models training on either Bayesian or maximum likelihood approaches produce highly stable and diverse protein sequences. We also fine-tuned the evolutionary scale ESM protein language model with reconstructed ancestral data to obtain evolutionary-driven protein representations, and downstream stability prediction tasks for Endolysin and Lysozyme C families. For Lysozyme C, ancestral-based representations outperformed the baseline ESM in KNN classification and matched the established InterPro method. In Endolysin, our novel ASR-Dist method performed on par with or better than the baseline and other fine-tuning approaches across various classification metrics. ASR-Dist showed consistent performance in both simple and complex classification models, suggesting the effectiveness of this data-centric approach in enhancing protein representations. This work demonstrates how evolutionary data can improve ML-driven protein engineering, presenting a novel data-centric approach that expands our exploration of protein sequence space and enhances our ability to predict and design functional proteins.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616292", "title": "De novo discovery of conserved gene clusters in microbial genomes with Spacedust", "authors": "Zhang, R.; Mirdita, M.; Soeding, J.", "author_corresponding": "Johannes Soeding", "author_corresponding_institution": "Max-Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "bioinformatics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616292.source.xml", "abstract": "Metagenomics has revolutionized environmental and human-associated microbiome studies.

In this work, a novel 2DTM metric, referred to as the 2DTM p-value, is developed to extend the 2DTM framework to more complex applications. The 2DTM p-value combines information from two previously used 2DTM metrics, namely the 2DTM signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and z-score, which are derived from the cross-correlation coefficient between the target and the template. The 2DTM p-value demonstrates robust detection accuracies under various imaging and sample conditions and outperforms the 2DTM SNR and z-score alone. Specifically, the 2DTM p-value improves the detection of aspherical targets such as a modified artificial tubulin patch particle (500 kDa) and a much smaller clathrin monomer (193 kDa) in simulated data. It also accurately recovers mature 60S ribosomes in yeast lamellae samples, even under conditions of increased Gaussian noise.

We show that, due to dramatic reduction in the stiffness of the highly charged Prothymosin- (ProT) with increasing concentration of GdmCl ([GdmCl]), the radius of gyration (Rg) decreases sharply till about 1.0M. Above 1.0M, ProT expands, caused by the swelling effect of GdmCl. In contrast, Rg of -Synuclein (Syn) swells as continuously as [GdmCl] increases, with most of the expansion occurring at concentrations less than 0.2M. Strikingly, the amplitude of the Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) profiles for ProT increases till [GdmCl]{approx} 1.0M and decreases beyond 1.0M. The [GdmCl]-dependent SAXS profiles for Syn, which has a pronounced bump at small wave vector (q [~] 0.5nm-1) at low [GdmCl] ([&le;] 0.2M), monotonically decrease at all values of [GdmCl]. The contrasting behavior predicted by the combination of MTM and SOP-IDP simulations may be qualitatively understood by modeling ProT as a strongly charged polyelectrolyte with nearly uniform density of charges along the chain contour and Syn as a nearly neutral polymer, except near the C-terminus where the uncompensated negatively charged residues are located.

This study was formed to develop a proof of concept measurement system that could be used to quaantify local plant biomechanical pressures during growth in in-situ assays. Using micro cone penetrometer root analogues, we tested the viability of combining X-ray computed tomography (XCT) with X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in order to understand whether we can characterize the mechanics during penetration associated with root growth. Cone penetrometers were used to penetrate into surrogate soil materials (e.g. gypsum), as these materials have porous and granular behaviour similar to natural soils but facilitate diffraction measurements due to their well defined atomic structures. Diffraction maps were generated across a sub region of the imaged space in order to quantify changes in the diffraction patterns. Diffraction maps are simplified representations by spectra peaks resulting from integrated Debeye-Scherrerr rings. Shifts in the spectra peaks are associated with deformations of the lattice crystals that comprise the surrogate soil material resulting from applied loads from the micro cone penetrometers. XCT images highlight compaction zones near the cone tip during penetration, with an increase in the compression zones radius as we push the cone deeper into the media. The XRD measurements peak shifts just outside of the local compacted zone of the cone. Qualitative finite element simulations illustrate that this is likely due to local inelastic deformations near the cone tip during penetration. However, the remote elastic deformations can be monitored as long as the inelastic zone remains local to the cone tip. While direct measurements near a root tip might be difficult due to the inelastic nature of the penetration process, the results show promise in terms of gaining insights into the locality of root growth biomechanical processes and the potential to elucidate root strategies under compacted soils in an in-situ test.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616316", "title": "Making Aptamers More Antibody-like: Targeting AXL in Vivo Using a Bottlebrush Polymer-Conjugated Aptamer", "authors": "Sun, T.; Lin, J.; Xue, C.; Wang, Y.; Chen, P.; Wei, Y.; Xu, G.; Sidonia, A.; Nenopoulos, C.; Tashkandi, H.; Zhang, K.", "author_corresponding": "Ke Zhang", "author_corresponding_institution": "Northeastern University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "cancer biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.02.616316.source.xml", "abstract": "The overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is linked to acquired drug resistance in cancer treatments.

In the context of non-persistently transmitted viruses, an important strategy is to change the plants metabolism to attract the vectors, and subsequently repel viruliferous insects from the infected plants to facilitate the virus transmission to neighbouring plants. The presence of satellite RNAs (satRNAs), which accompany certain plant RNA virus species and strains, leads to changes in the host plants, such as alterations in the virus-induced infection symptoms, either exacerbating or attenuating them. This study aimed to analyse the influence of satRNAs on the orientation and feeding behaviour of the cucumovirus insect vector - Myzus persicae, which might consequently contribute to the virus transmission efficiency. The hypothesis behind this study was that satRNAs of cucumoviruses alter these insect activities toward virus-infected plants, and strongly symptom-deteriorating satRNAs might negatively affect the attractiveness of the infected plants for aphids. Using two cucumoviruses, peanut stunt virus (PSV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and their satRNAs, which induce divergent infection symptoms, olfactometry and electrical penetration graph (EPG) monitoring analyses were performed. The results showed that satRNAs which presence leads to disease symptom exacerbation might alter the orientation behaviour of aphids by reducing the attractiveness of the plants and discouraging aphids from feeding. This phenomenon may contribute to the better persistence in the environment of satRNAs alleviating disease symptoms compared to the worsening ones, benefiting the virus by not destroying the plant and prolonging the virus exposure to insect vectors.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616320", "title": "Onco-fetal protein Nogo-A restricts human and mouse glioma vascularization and growth via VEGF-Notch-hippo-metabolic signaling", "authors": "Schwab, M.; Ghobrial, M.; Macias, J.

Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is highly dynamic during brain development, enters a mostly quiescent state in the adult homeostatic brain, and is reactivated in vascular-dependent CNS diseases including brain tumors. In consequence, a better understanding of the relevance of the onco-fetal axis - describing the reactivation of fetal signaling programs in tumors - in endothelial- and perivascular cells of the human brain tumor vasculature harbors great translational potential, yet remains poorly defined. In development, neurovascular link (NVL) molecules guide both neuronal growth cones as well as capillary endothelial tip cells. Nogo-A is an NVL molecule known to inhibit axonal growth in the developing and adult CNS and to restrict angiogenesis during brain development, but its role in the mouse and human brain tumor vasculature along the onco-fetal axis remains unknown. Here, we characterize Nogo-A as an onco-fetal protein expressed in the neurovascular unit (NVU) in human fetal brains and human gliomas in vivo that negatively regulates sprouting angiogenesis and endothelial tip cells in glioma vascularization. The Nogo-A-specific Delta 20 domain restricts angiogenic sprouting and branching and promotes vascular normalization while inhibiting glioma growth in experimental gliomas. Moreover, Nogo-A expression in tumor cells negatively correlate/s with glioma malignancy in vivo. In vitro, Nogo-A Delta 20 reduced human brain- and brain tumor endothelial cell (HBMVEC, HBTMVEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) spreading, migration, and sprouting, in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited filopodia extension glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing of Nogo-A Delta 20-treated HBMVECs and HBTMVECs revealed Nogo-A Delta 20-induced positive regulation of the angiogenesis-inhibiting Dll4-Notch-pathway and inhibition of the angiogenesis-promoting VEGF-VEGFR and Hippo-YAP-TAZ pathways, whereas metabolomics and functional metabolic assays revealed Nogo-A Delta 20-induced negative regulation of endothelial glycolysis in HBMVECs and HBTMVECs. These findings characterize Nogo-A as an onco-fetal protein in the human glial brain tumor vasculature and identify Nogo-A Delta 20 signaling as an important negative regulator of human glioma vascularization and growth.

Here, we present a draft report describing Chemopleth 1.0, a chemoarchitecture database for the rat hypothalamus (HY) and zona incerta (ZI), which will eventually feature downloadable interactive maps featuring the census distributions of five immunoreactive neurochemical systems: (1) vasopressin (as detected using its gene co-product, copeptin); (2) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.13.39); (3) hypocretin 1/orexin A; (4) melanin-concentrating hormone; and (5) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. These maps are formatted for the widely used Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) open-access rat brain atlas. Importantly, this dataset retains atlas stereotaxic coordinates that facilitate the precise targeting of the cell bodies and/or axonal fibers of these neurochemical systems, thereby potentially serving to streamline delivery of viral vectors for gene-directed manipulations. The maps will be presented together with novel open-access tools to visualize the data, including a new Python programming language-based workflow to quantify cell positions and fiber densities for BM4.0.

Leveraging Cre recombinase mouse models for cell type labeling, we generated a comprehensive atlas of cell-type-specific distributions throughout the male and female brain.

With the growing prevalence of single-cell analysis, there is an urgency to generate connectomes of individual neurons that project to brain-wide regions. This work reports a scalable approach to build neuron connection networks of mouse brains by mapping whole-brain single-neuron connectivity using two complementary methods at sub-neuronal levels. We first generated an arbor-net by partitioning and probabilistically pairing dendritic and axonal arbors of 20,247 neurons registered to the Allen Brain Atlas. We also produced a bouton-net based on 2.57 million putative boutons detected along single axons of 1,877 fully reconstructed neurons and probabilistic pairing of these full-morphology datasets. Our cross-validation of both the arbor-net and bouton-net showed statistical consistency in the spatially and anatomically modular distributions of neuronal connections, which also corresponded to functional modules of the mouse brain. Our single-neuron connections were also validated by two existing independent connectomes of coarser resolution based on viral tracing of neuron populations and barcoding-and-sequencing, as well as an independent synaptome containing the relative density distribution of synapses. We further found that single neuronal connections correlated more strongly with gene co-expression at both the brain region and single-cell levels than the previous full-brain mesoscale connectome of a mouse brain. Our findings allow the assembly of a new whole-brain scale single-neuron resolution connectome for all brain regions, called SEU-net. We studied the properties of our connectomes in comparison with other potential brain architectures and found a series of non-random subnetwork patterns in the form of consistent triad motifs.

We observed that cognitive performance of 6 months old Tg2576 mice significantly improved upon SO treatment, whereas no change was observed in 11 months old mice. Histochemical assessment of amyloid plaques demonstrated that SO-treated 11 months old Tg2576 mice had significantly less plaque burden than placebo-treated ones, whereas ELISA of insoluble protein fractions from 6 months old Tg2576 mice brains indicated lower A{beta}-42/A{beta}-40 ratio in SO-treated group vs. placebo-treated controls.

Despite extensive efforts from academy and industry, no cure is available to date. Sleep may be a modifiable factor involved in onset, progression and potentially also treatment of AD. However, knowledge regarding important aspects of sleep-targeted treatments is missing, e.g. adequate window of opportunity for their efficacious application, their minimal duration or their effect onto both pathology and cognition. We found that pharmacologically enhanced sleep depth is associated with reduced amyloid neuropathology in AD mice brains at both early- and moderately advanced-stage disease.

The Pfn2 3untranslated region has a binding site for Iron Regulatory Proteins and a nearby binding site for ESC enriched microRNAs (2,3). Deletion of this microRNA site leads to increased PFN2 and reduced FGF signaling during pluripotency transition prior to germ layer formation (4). In contrast, deletion of the iron response element leads to decreased PFN2 and a Wnt signaling defect, reduced nuclear beta-catenin, and a subsequent block in mesendodermal lineages during early germ layer formation.

We analyzed kidney transcriptomes from 34 species to quantify and characterize convergent evolution at the level of gene expression, tissue composition, and coding sequences. We found that several genes showed convergent expression changes, some of which also carried convergent changes in their coding sequence. We then subdivided these data to test the influence of evolutionary history.

Second, we compared data for recent (within genera) and ancient (between genera) adaptations, and observed more convergent changes in the latter.

However, organisms can circumvent trade-offs in specific environmental contexts through phenotypic plasticity, though the mechanisms that drive trade-offs or allow organisms to resolve trade-offs are often cryptic. The trade-off between water loss and gas exchange poses a fundamental challenge for terrestrial life because the capacity to absorb oxygen is limited by the risk of desiccation from water loss across respiratory surfaces. Here, we investigated the capacity to mitigate this trade-off in a lungless salamander that breathes exclusively across its skin. We measured water loss and oxygen uptake using respirometry in field- and laboratory-based studies to identify plastic responses to environmental variation, coupled with gene expression analyses to investigate biological pathways that regulate the trade-off. Though the trade-off between oxygen uptake and water loss was generally strong, we observed that its strength changed over time in the field and laboratory. At the molecular level, we found support for antagonistic pleiotropy in multiple pathways that simultaneously affect both physiological traits (e.g., via vasoconstriction and downregulation of aerobic respiration), and for mechanisms that mitigate the trade-off by affecting only one trait (e.g., oxygen binding affinity, melanin synthesis). As organisms disentangle such conflicts, however, alternative trade-offs are likely to arise.

During the 4-day hackathon, we tested our workflow on several distinct software packages for chromatin structure modeling and we discovered several challenges that include: 1) different aspects of chromatin biophysics and scales complicate model comparisons, 2) expertise in biology, bioinformatics, and physics is necessary to conduct a comprehensive research on chromatin structure, 3) bioinformatic software, which is often developed in academic settings, is characterized by insufficient support and documentation.

Human immune responses to infections caused by respiratory viruses are complex and dependent on the length of time the host has been infected.

Transcriptomic data is available from a large amount of publicly available viral challenge studies and genome-wide transcriptomic data is primarily derived from bulk samples containing mixed cell subpopulations. Traditional bulk transcriptomic analysis methods often utilize deconvolution techniques to study changes in cell proportions of major immune cell types.\n\nMethods and Principal FindingsIn this study, we digitally sorted the cellular diversity of 31 blood immune cell types over time in human challenge studies after inoculation by H3N2 influenza virus H1N1 influenza virus, and RSV using xCell, a digital cell separation method, on human bulk transcriptional repository data. We identified common inoculation-induced changes in cell subpopulations across studies of the three viruses with time kinetics. We observed a consistent elevation of myeloid cells and their subtypes post-inoculation across various viral inoculations. Lymphocytes and their subpopulations were reduced in symptomatic and infected (Sx/Inf) participants compared to asymptomatic and uninfected (Asx/Uninf) participants. H3N2 evoked the earliest transcriptional immune responses, followed by H1N1, RSV infection elicited a delayed transcriptional response compared to both influenza viruses likely due to slower replication kinetics. Our analysis also revealed unique immune cell composition changes caused by specific viruses. We found that pre-existing baseline memory T cells were associated with resistance to influenza viral infection and that the key cell type is effector memory (Tem) CD8 T cells.\n\nConclusionThese findings identify specific target cell subpopulations which respond to respiratory virus inoculation over time, shedding light on mechanisms for eliciting a robust baseline level of immune memory against multiple viral strains.

However, mapping the location of these regulatory elements in the genome and precisely characterizing their spatial and temporal activity remain important challenges. Here we introduce a novel in vivo and in silico method for spatial single-cell enhancer-reporter assays (spatial-scERA) designed to reconstruct the spatial activity of multiple candidate enhancer regions in parallel in a multicellular organism. Spatial-scERA integrates massively parallel reporter assays coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial reconstruction using optimal transport, to map cell-type-specific enhancer activity at the single-cell level on a 3D virtual representation of the sample. We evaluated spatial-scERA in stage 6 Drosophila embryos using 25 candidate enhancers (including 19 previously uncharacterized regions), and validated the robustness of our predicted reconstructions by comparing them to microscopy images generated by in situ hybridization. Remarkably, spatial-scERA faithfully reconstructed the spatial activity of these enhancers, even when the enhancer-reporter construct was expressed in as few as 10 cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of integrating transcriptomic and spatial data for the accurate prediction of enhancer activity patterns in complex multicellular samples. Indeed, we found that chromatin modifications and open chromatin regions are often poor predictors of enhancer activity. Moreover, spatial data can often be essential for the accurate annotation of scRNA-seq clusters. Overall, spatial-scERA provides a scalable approach to map spatio-temporal enhancer spatial activity at single-cell resolution without the need for imaging or a priori knowledge of embryology and can be applied to any multicellular organism amenable to transgenesis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616087", "title": "Combined Nanodrops Imaging and Ultrasound Localization Microscopy for Detecting Intracerebral Hemorrhage", "authors": "LIN, B.-Z.; Fan, A.

These networks often exhibit characteristics of spatially-distributed excitable systems, with propagating waves of signaling activity that govern processes such as cell migration, division, and other essential physiological functions. Traditionally, these reaction-diffusion systems have been modeled using stochastic partial differential equations incorporating spatial Langevin-type dynamics. Although these knowledge-based models have provided valuable insights, they are typically not directly inferred from experimental data. In this study, we introduce and apply two data-driven methodologies for learning the structure and parameters of spatial Langevin equation (SLE) models: 1) Kramers-Moyal regression, an adaptation of an established approach to fit microscale stochastic dynamics, and 2) wave features optimization, a novel approach to match macroscale spatiotemporal patterns. Unlike black-box neural network models that predict system behavior but provide no mechanistic insight, this approach estimates nonlinear model equations that directly relate to system structure and dynamics. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on simulation datasets derived from two stochastic reaction-diffusion models: one based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations (FHN model) and another on a biochemically adapted version of the FHN equations (FR model). Our results demonstrate that optimizing stochastic dynamics and wave patterns enables the accurate estimation of SLE model structure and parameters directly from 1D and 2D spatial data. With sparsity enforcement, we also identify novel sparse reaction-diffusion models for excitable systems. We show that this approach effectively approximates system behavior even when working with datasets similar to experimental conditions, with low temporal resolution and unobserved molecular components.

Previous work characterizing FLT3 protein expression in the brain have not yielded convincing results, mainly limited by the low expression level of FLT3 and poor sensitivity of standard immunolabeling method using fluorescent secondary antibody. In this study, we report the systematic characterization of FLT3 protein localization during brain development using a highly sensitive immunolabeling methodology based on alkaline phosphatase (AP) polymer biochemistry. Our results reveal a previously unknown neuron-selective FLT3 expression pattern in both mouse and human cerebellum tissue samples, and demonstrate a gradual increase in the total FLT3 protein level and a cytosolic-to-dendritic change in subcellular FLT3 distribution during mouse cerebellum development. Through combining the AP immunolabeling of FLT3 with standard immunostaining of various cell type markers to achieve hybrid co-labeling of multiple antigens in tissue sections, we demonstrate that the main cell type that express FLT3 in the cerebellum is PV+, Calbindin+ Purkinje cells. To expand the use case of AP immunolabeling method in labeling neuronal proteins, we show robust labeling of Kir2.1, a potassium channel protein that is expressed at low level in neurons, in brain tissue sections collected from mouse, pig, and human brains.

PC states that the brain computes internal models of expected events and responds robustly to unexpected stimuli with prediction errors that feed forward. This can be studied using oddball tasks. A repetitive sequence interrupted by a novel stimulus is a \"local\" oddball. \"Global\" oddballs defy expectations while repeating the local context. This dissociates expectation-driven neuronal prediction error responses vs. merely stimulus-history-driven release from adaptation. We recorded neuron spiking activity across the visual hierarchy in mice and monkeys viewing these oddballs. Local oddball responses largely followed PC hypotheses. They were robust, emerged early in layers 2/3, and fed forward. Global oddball responses challenged PC. They were weak, absent in most visual areas, more robust in prefrontal cortex, and emerged in non-granular layers. Contrary to the most popular PC models that emphasize prediction error computations occurring in early sensory areas and feeding forward, this implies that genuine predictive coding computations take place in more cognitive, higher-order areas.\n\nHighlightsO_LICore principles of Predictive Coding hold for local, but not global oddballs\nC_LIO_LIGlobal oddballs are sparsely encoded in visual cortex and do not engage feedforward mechanisms\nC_LIO_LIParvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons do not support sensory global oddball detection\nC_LIO_LIGlobal oddballs are earliest and most robustly encoded in prefrontal brain areas\nC_LI\n\nSignificanceGlobal oddballs defy our expectations without defying their local context.

While CAR-T cell therapy has proven effective for hematological malignancies, it faces challenges in treating solid tumors due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and physical barriers hindering CAR-T cell infiltration. NK cells, particularly adaptive NK (aNK) cells, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization and their resistance to immunosuppressive environments.\n\nPurposeThe study investigates the role of cytokines, specifically IL-21 and IL-15, in enhancing aNK cell expansion and activation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma (GBM) patients.\n\nMethodsBuffy coats and GBM TILs were collected from Karolinska Hospital. NK cells were isolated and expanded in vitro with IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines and feeder cells (K562 and K562E). Furthermore, tumor lysate was added in the cultures to boost memory responses in aNK cells. NK cell functionality, cytotoxicity, and phenotyping was assessed using flow cytometry and statistical analysis (t-test and two-way ANOVA) used to validate the results. Further animal model was used to validate the cytotoxicity capacities of these cells against GBM tumors using a zebrafish model.\n\nResultsIL-21 drives the expansion of aNK better than IL-15 controls, data shown in PBMCs and TILs derived from GBM patients and IPLA OVCA patients. Additionally, the use of tumor lysate as a booster for restimulation further amplifies the cytotoxic capacity of aNK cells against autologous tumors. The zebrafish model validates this method, by decreasing the tumor size in zebrafish animals after 3 days of injection.\n\nConclusionThe results demonstrate that IL-21 is essential for the specific expansion of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. Additionally, tumor lysate significantly increases the cytotoxic efficacy of aNK cells upon restimulation with the same tumor cells. These findings suggest that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the specific expansion and activation of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells.\n\nBy optimizing the expansion protocol, this method aims to advance the clinical application of aNK cells in immunotherapies for solid tumors, offering a potential solution to the limitations faced by current CAR-T therapies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616363", "title": "PPAR\u03b3 downregulation in colonic CD8+ T cells results in epithelial barrier disruption in people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy", "authors": "Das Adhikari, U.; Froehle, L.

The presence of metal and antibiotic resistance genes within microbial communities can be informative about both issues. The Laurentian Great Lakes contain nearly 20% of the worlds supply of freshwater; however, it is unclear how these genes are changing over time in this system. In this study, we characterized these genes in nearly two hundred metagenomes collected from multiple sites in western Lake Erie at a five-year time interval: 2014-2019. 11 metal resistance genes (MRGs) and nine antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were characterized and demonstrated significant changes in diversity and spatial distribution.

The chimeric virus demonstrated similar characteristics with the parental virus of S gene. The reporter tag stably expressed after five serial passages in the susceptible cells, and the reporter virus could be applied to evaluate the sensitivity of antiviral inhibitors using the luciferase assay system to detect HiBiT tag.

We annotated large conservation of macrosynteny between E. elegans and other Edwardsiidae anemones as well as conservation of both microRNAs and ultra conserved noncoding elements previously reported in other cnidarians species. We also highlight microsyntenic variation of clustered developmental genes and ancient gene clusters that vary between species of sea anemones, despite previous research showing conservation between cnidarians and bilaterians. Overall, our analysis of the E. elegans genome highlights the importance of using multiple species to represent a taxonomic group for genomic comparisons, where genomic variation can be missed for large and diverse clades.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616390", "title": "Decoding Collagen's Thermally Induced Unfolding and Refolding Pathways", "authors": "Al-Shaer, A.; Forde, N.

Despite inherent thermal instability of individual proteins at body temperature, collagen manages to assemble into higher-order structures that provide mechanical support to tissues. Sequence features that enhance collagen stability have been deduced largely from studies of collagen-mimetic peptides, as the large sizes of collagens have precluded high-resolution studies of their structure. Thus, there is a need for new methods to analyze the structure and mechanics of native collagen proteins. In this study, we used AFM imaging to investigate the temperature response of collagen types I, III and particularly IV. We observed a time-dependent loss of folded structures upon exposure to body temperature, with structural destabilization along the collagenous domain reflected by a shorter overall contour length. We characterized the sequence-dependent bending stiffness profile of collagen IV as a function of temperature and identified a putative initiation site for thermally induced unfolding. Interchain disulfide bonds in collagen IV were shown to enhance thermal stability and serve as the primary nucleation sites for in vitro refolding. In contrast to the canonical C-to-N terminal folding direction, we found an interchain cystine knot to enable folding in the opposite direction. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that this cystine knot is evolutionarily conserved across metazoan phyla, highlighting its significance in the stabilization of early collagen IV structures. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the unfolding and refolding pathway of collagen IV, providing valuable insight into how its heterogeneous sequence influences stability and mechanics.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616404", "title": "Interaction hierarchy among Cdv proteins drives recruitment to membrane necks", "authors": "De Franceschi, N.; Blanch-Jover, A.; Dekker, C.", "author_corresponding": "Cees Dekker", "author_corresponding_institution": "Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "biochemistry", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.616404.source.xml", "abstract": "Cell division in the crenarchaea is accomplished by the Cdv system.

Here, we use an in vitro reconstituted system to explore how protein interactions among these Cdv proteins govern their recruitment to the membrane. We show that CdvA does not bind the membrane unless in complex with CdvB. We find that CdvB2 can polymerize if its self-inhibitory domain is removed, and that by itself is exhibits poor binding to the membrane. However, CdvB2 can be efficiently recruited to the membrane by both CdvB1 and CdvB. Furthermore, the CdvB1:CdvB2 co-polymer can be recruited to the membrane by CdvA:CdvB. By reconstituting these proteins in dumbbell-shaped liposomes, we show that Cdv proteins have a strong preference to localize at membrane necks of high curvature.

Existing software tools, namely peak-callers, are available for analyzing data from these technologies, although they often struggle with diffuse and broad signals, such as those associated with broad histone post-translational modifications (PTMs).\n\nResultsTo address this limitation, we present ChIPbinner, an open-source R package tailored for reference-agnostic analysis of broad PTMs. Instead of relying on pre-identified enriched regions from peak-callers, ChIPbinner divides (bins) the genome into uniform windows. Thus, users are provided with an unbiased method to explore genome-wide differences between two samples using scatterplots, principal component analysis (PCA), and correlation plots. It also facilitates the identification and characterization of differential clusters of bins, allowing users to focus on specific genomic regions significantly affected by treatments or mutations. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool through a case study assessing H3K36me2 depletion following NSD1 knockout in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting the advantages of ChIPbinner in detecting broad histone mark changes over existing software.\n\nConclusionsBinned analysis provides a more holistic view of the genomic landscape, allowing researchers to uncover broader patterns and correlations that may be missed when solely focusing on individual peaks.

In neurons, these channels are activated through a coordinated response to both signals; however, for BK channels to respond to physiological voltage changes, elevated concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ (ranging from 1 to 10 M) are necessary. As a result, it is believed that BK channels are typically localized within nanodomains near Ca2+ sources (approximately 20-50 nm), such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Since the first evidence of NMDAR-BK channel coupling reported by Isaacson and Murphy in 2001 in the olfactory bulb, further studies have identified functional coupling between NMDARs and BK channels in other regions of the brain, emphasizing their importance in neuronal function. Mutations in the genes encoding NMDAR subunits have been directly linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. For instance, mutations such as V15M and V618G in the GRIN2B gene, which encodes the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, are implicated in the pathogenesis of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE27). Here, we explored the effects of these two GluN2B mutations on NMDAR-BK channel coupling, employing a combination of electrophysiological, biochemical, and imaging techniques. Taken together, our results demonstrate that mutation V618G specifically disrupts NMDAR-BK complex formation, impairing functional coupling, in spite of robust individual channel expression in the membrane.

While the FLT3 signaling pathway has been extensively studied in blood cell development and leukemia, its role in the brain remains largely unexplored. Through our groups previous high-throughput drug screening work unexpectedly found that several small molecule FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i), including KW-2449 and Sunitinib, enhance expression of the gene encoding chloride transporter KCC2 in neurons. KCC2 is crucial for brain development and function, and its dysregulation is linked to many brain diseases. These findings suggest previously unrecognized roles of FLT3 signaling in brain health and disease that have yet to be systematically studied. In this study, we utilized a functional genomics approach to investigate the transcriptomic changes induced by pharmacological inhibition of the FLT3 pathway in brain cells, including cultured primary mouse neurons, a human stem cell-derived neuronal model of Rett syndrome (RTT), and human stem cell-derived microglia cultures. Our results show that treating human or mouse neurons with FLT3i drugs significantly upregulates genes crucial for brain development while downregulating genes linked to neuroinflammation. In contrast, FLT3i treatment of human microglia, which do not express FLT3, has no effect on their gene expression, highlighting the cell type-specific roles of FLT3 signaling in the brain. To further understand how FLT3 signaling regulates the expression of neuronal maturation genes such as KCC2, we conducted a curated CRISPR screen that identified a number of transcription factors involved in FLT3i-mediated KCC2 activation in neurons. The mRNA and protein levels of several neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes are significantly upregulated in FLT3i-treated neurons, indicating potential therapeutic applications of FLT3i in rescuing underexpression and/or haploinsufficiency of disease-associated genes. In our in vivo studies, we evaluated the efficacy of the FLT3i drug KW-2449 in mice, demonstrating that it can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, induce KCC2 protein expression for up to 24 hours after a single injection, and reduces seizure activity in a chemoconvulsant-induced mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unrecognized roles of neuron-specific FLT3 signaling in promoting neuronal maturation and reducing neuroinflammation. These results suggest that FLT3 kinase signaling regulates a transcriptional program vital for brain development and function, position it as a promising therapeutic target for NDD treatment.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616330", "title": "Optimal control of spiking neural networks", "authors": "Costa, T.; Castineiras de Saa, J.

In optimal control, the target dynamics should maximize a notion of long-term value along trajectories, possibly subject to control costs. Because this problem is, in general, not tractable, current approaches to the control of networks mostly consider simplified settings (e.g., variations of the Linear-Quadratic Regulator). Here, we present a mathematical framework for optimal control of recurrent networks of stochastic spiking neurons with low-rank connectivity. An essential ingredient is a control-cost that penalizes deviations from the default dynamics of the network (specified by its recurrent connections), which motivates the controller to use the default dynamics as much as possible. We derive a Bellman Equation that specifies a Value function over the low-dimensional network state (LDS), and a corresponding optimal control input. The optimal control law takes the form of a feedback controller that provides external excitatory (inhibitory) synaptic input to neurons in the recurrent network if their spiking activity tends to move the LDS towards regions of higher (lower) Value. We use our theory to study the problem of steering the state of the network towards particular terminal regions which can lie either in or out of regions in the LDS with slow dynamics, in analogy to standard BMI experiments.

With the goal of improving conservation efforts through state-of-the-art survey techniques in hypersaline ecosystems, this study tests the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for metazoan biomonitoring. We employed a multi-assay approach utilizing three genetic markers--12S rRNA, 18S rRNA, and COI --to analyze biodiversity in two types of environmental substrates, sediment and water. These samples were collected from three hypersaline lakes situated at high altitude in Northern Chile: Salar de Atacama (Laguna Puilar), Salar de Pujsa, and Salar de Tara. In addition, we compared the eDNA outputs with results generated from aquatic macroinvertebrate assessments using kick-nets to evaluate the potential for complementary sampling approaches. Our eDNA analyses revealed a total of 21 and 22 taxa across the three hypersaline lakes in sediment and water, respectively. Within both substrates, the highest diversity was found in Salar de Tara (15 taxa within sediment and 13 taxa from water). Our multi-assay design was able to detect a range of resident hypersaline taxa with different conservation status, spanning from rotifers (Encentrum) to endangered snails (Heleobia atacamensis), to amphipods (Hyalella) and flamingos (Pheonicopterus). Macroinvertebrate presence/absence data derived from conventional kick-net surveys further validated Salar de Tara as the most biodiverse system. Compared to net-based assessments, eDNA analysis allowed more refined taxonomic assignments for copepods and ostracods, while certain taxa such as Ephydridae or Hirudinea were not detected through molecular tests. Overall, this study provides evidence that eDNA is an effective tool to elucidate fine scale taxa assemblages and can refine conservation efforts in hypersaline lakes.

Considerable evidence implies altered processing of frustration about missed rewards, but few studies investigated the preceding and thus potentially predictive reward anticipation and initial delivery processing in children with AD.\n\nMethodsA total of 103 children aged 8 to 12 years (50 with AD and 53 without AD) were examined during a monetary reward anticipation task with event-related potential (ERP) components resolving reward anticipation (cue-CNV [Contingent Negative Variation]) and reward delivery phases (Reward Positivity and Feedback-Related Negativity). All components were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Regression analyses also evaluated the associations between those ERP components and dimensional AD symptoms.\n\nResultsChildren with AD showed attenuated anticipatory reward processing compared to No-ADs. The CNV at fronto-central site (FCz) showed a significant group effect (No-AD>AD, p=0.017). Post-hoc test showed that this group difference was stronger for the cue monetary condition (monetary cue: p=.007, d=0.56, verbal cue: p=.901, d=0.16), and that only the No-AD group showed a significant difference between conditions (p<0.001). No significant effects were obtained for the delivery phase. Regression analysis showed that a reduced anticipatory CNV at FCz significantly explained AD symptoms, and that anger/irritability and anxiety/depressive symptoms predicted a reduced anticipatory CNV at FCz.\n\nConclusionThis neurophysiological characterization of reward anticipation and delivery in children with AD demonstrates altered neural activity in AD during anticipation of reward rather than following the delivery (or omission) of the reward itself.

High-definition TG tACS (6 Hz theta, 75 Hz gamma) or sham tACS was applied over right M1 for 20 minutes during a ballistic left-thumb abduction motor training task performed in two experimental sessions. Motor skill acquisition was quantified as changes in movement acceleration during and up to 60 minutes after training.

The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains poorly understood. Pvalb-positive cINs are particularly important for regulating cortical circuits through strong perisomatic inhibition, yet they have been difficult to model in vitro. Here we investigated the role of the environment in shaping and maintaining Pvalb cINs. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into a variety of 2D and 3D co-culture models, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic systems with dissociated cells, organoids, organotypic cultures, and conditioned media. Across models, we observed distinct proportions of Sst- and Pvalb-positive cIN descendants. Strikingly, grafting MGE progenitors into 3D human, but not mouse, corticogenesis models led to efficient, non-autonomous differentiation of Pvalb-positive cINs. This differentiation was characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets. Furthermore, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive cINs, when grafted onto human cortical models, also upregulated Pvalb expression.

Developing effective new vaccines will require identifying which of the roughly 4000 proteins in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteome are presented on MHC class II (MHC-II) by infected human phagocytes and can be recognized by CD4+ T cells to mediate protective immunity. Vaccines must also elicit T cell responses recognizing the same peptide-MHC complexes presented by infected cells, and successful presentation of target human MHC-II peptides is currently challenging to evaluate and optimize. Here, we define antigenic targets for TB vaccine development by using mass spectrometry (MS) for proteome-wide discovery of Mtb epitopes presented on MHC-II by infected human cells.

We monitored colonic dysplasia progression, colitis kinetics and severity by lipocalin-2, cytokine measurement, and tissue evaluations of colon and liver. We manipulated the microbiome to assess its functional effects.\n\nResultsDKO mice exhibited age- and region-specific accelerated colitis and spontaneous colonic dysplasia progressing to high-grade invasive adenocarcinomas. Despite aggressive colonic inflammation, DKO mice showed reduced hepatic fibrosis, increased hepatic reparative macrophages, and matrix metalloproteinase activity compared to Mdr2-/- mice.

However, a significant challenge in evaluating the efficacy of these approaches is the lack of models that can precisely characterize the consequences of TEAD inhibition. To address this gap, our laboratory developed a strategy that utilizes a fluorescently traceable, dominant-negative protein named TEADi. TEADi specifically blocks the nuclear interactions of TEAD with YAP1 and TAZ, enabling precise dissection of Hippo TEAD-dependent and independent effects on cell fate. In this study, we aimed to enhance TEADi effectiveness by altering post-transcriptional modification sites within its TEAD-binding domains (TBDs). We demonstrate that a D93E mutation in the YAP1 TBD significantly increases TEADi inhibitory capacity. Additionally, we find that TBDs derived from VGLL4 and YAP1 are insufficient to block TAZ-induced TEAD activity, revealing crucial differences in YAP1 and TAZ displacement mechanisms by dominant-negative TBDs. Structural differences in YAP1 and TAZ TBDs were also identified, which may contribute to the distinct binding of these proteins to TEAD.

We investigate bill kinematics during nectar feeding in six species of hummingbirds. We employed geometric morphometrics to identify bending zones and combined these data with measurements of bill flexural rigidity from microCT scans to better understand the flexing mechanism. We found that the mandible remains in place throughout the licking cycle, while the maxilla undergoes significant shape deformation, such that the distal portion of the upper bill bends upwards. We propose that bill bending is a key component of the drinking mechanism in hummingbirds, allowing the coordination of bill function (distal wringing and basal expansion) and tongue function (raking/squeegeeing) during intraoral transport. We present a fluid analysis that reveals a combination of pressure-driven (Poiseuille) and boundary-driven (Couette) flows, which have previously been thought to represent alternative drinking mechanisms.

Preventing future infectious outbreaks and developing efficient mitigation protocols can benefit from advanced computational modeling approaches. Here, we developed an agent-based modeling approach to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of an infection outbreak in a confined environment caused by a specific pathogen and to determine effective infection containment protocols. The approach integrates the 3D geographic information system of a confined environment, the behavior of the hosts, key biological parameters about the pathogen obtained from the experimental data, and the general mechanics of host-pathogen and pathogen-fomite interactions. To assess our approach, we applied it to the historical data of infectious outbreak caused by norovirus, H1N1 influenza A, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. As a result our model was able to accurately predict the number of infections per day, correctly identify the day when the CDC vessel sanitation protocol would be triggered, single out key biological parameters affecting the infection spread, and propose important changes to existing containment protocols, specific for different pathogens. This research not only contributes to our understanding of infection spread and containment in cruise ships but also offers insights applicable to other similar confined settings, such as nursing homes, schools, and hospitals.

However, little is known about the physiological basis for this function. Here we show that the thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We found that skin was the largest target in a mouse body for dietary fat delivery, and that dietary triglyceride was assimilated both by epidermis and by dermal white adipose tissue. Skin from mice calorie-restricted for 3 weeks did not take up circulating lipids and showed a highly depleted stratum corneum. Dietary triglyceride acyl groups persist in skin for weeks after feeding. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, we have implicated both keratinocytes and sebocytes in the altered lipids which correlate with thermal function. In response to high fat feeding, wax diesters and ceramides accumulate, and triglycerides become more saturated. In contrast, in response to the dramatic loss of adipose tissue that accompanies restriction of the branched chain amino acid isoleucine, skin becomes more heat-permeable, resisting changes induced by Western diet feeding, with a signature of depleted signaling lipids. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616225", "title": "Unveiling the role of miRNAs from MSC-EVs in neuroinflammation and behavioral impairments induced by chronic alcohol consumption", "authors": "Mellado, S.; Touahri, N.; Montagud-Romero, S.; Perpina-Clerigues, C.; Garcia-Garcia, F.; Moreno-Manzano, V.; Guerri, C.; Rodriguez-Arias, M.; Pascual, M.", "author_corresponding": "Maria Pascual", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Valencia", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.616225.source.xml", "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs) have emerged as a promising form of regenerative and immunomodulatory therapy; indeed, micro (mi)RNAs contained within MSC-EVs modulate target gene expression and impact disease-associated pathways.

A potential solution is brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which could allow them to voluntarily control external devices (e.g., robotic arm) by decoding brain activity to movement commands. In the past decade, deep-learning decoders have achieved state-of-the-art results in most BMI applications, ranging from speech production to finger control. However, the  black-box nature of deep-learning decoders could lead to unexpected behaviors, resulting in major safety concerns in real-world physical control scenarios. In these applications, explainable but lower-performing decoders, such as the Kalman filter (KF), remain the norm. In this study, we designed a BMI decoder based on KalmanNet, an extension of the KF that augments its operation with recurrent neural networks to compute the Kalman gain. This results in a varying \"trust\" that shifts between inputs and dynamics. We used this algorithm to predict finger movements from the brain activity of two monkeys. We compared KalmanNet results offline (pre-recorded data, n = 13 days) and online (real-time predictions, n = 5 days) with a simple KF and two recent deep-learning algorithms with state-of-the-art results: tcFNN and LSTM. KalmanNet achieved comparable or better results than other deep learning models in offline and online modes, relying on the dynamical model for stopping while depending more on neural inputs for initiating movements. We further validated this mechanism by implementing a heteroscedastic KF that used the same strategy, and it also approached state-of-the-art performance while remaining in the explainable domain of standard KFs. However, we also see two downsides to KalmanNet. KalmanNet shares the limited generalization ability of existing deep-learning decoders, and its usage of the KF as an inductive bias limits its performance in the presence of unseen noise distributions. Despite this trade-off, our analysis successfully integrates traditional controls and modern deep-learning approaches to motivate high-performing yet still explainable BMI designs.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616089", "title": "A triple serine motif in the intracellular domains of sortilin-related receptors SorCS1-3 regulates neurotrophic activity", "authors": "Dalby, A.; Ollendorff, M.

A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model, as previous attempts failed to identify a suitable host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans that is a causative agent of encephalitis. VA1 RNA levels peak in heart tissue at day 7 post-inoculation. The cardiotropism was observed in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds evidenced by high VA1 RNA loads in heart tissue of A/J, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, Balb/c, and J:ARC mice. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Intracellular viral capsid was present in tissue sections based on immunofluorescent staining and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA co-localizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by > 10-fold in heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we also tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in human cardiac microvascular and coronary artery endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of viral pathogenesis and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryAstroviruses typically cause viral diarrhea in humans but can also cause serious infections of the brain. Previously, the methods available to study how these viruses lead to invasive infections were limited. Here, we describe the first system to study human-infecting astroviruses using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infected heart tissue and was associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of virus in their hearts and blood. Linking back to human health, we also found that VA1 can infect cells derived from human blood vessels of the heart. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans. In the future, we can develop interventions that will prevent and treat astrovirus infections in humans.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616447", "title": "Microgravity and low muon radiation affect viral pathogenesis and physiology in Caenorhabditis elegans", "authors": "Villena-Gimenez, A.; Castiglioni, V.

Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities.

To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this study, we investigated why older age is linked to more severe COVID-19 outcomes by comparing the progression of the disease in young (2 months) and elderly (15-22 months) K18(hACE2) mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. After exposing both groups to the virus, we assessed various factors such as viral loads, immune responses, and lipid profiles in the lungs at different time points. Our findings revealed that elderly mice struggled to clear the virus by day 7 post-infection, leading to higher mortality rates and poorer recovery compared to younger mice. Aged mice showed weaker immune responses, with reduced production of key antiviral proteins like IFNg and certain chemokines. Lipid analysis also highlighted differences in molecules involved in immune regulation and lung protection, such as decreased levels of pro-resolving lipids and increased lipids associated with lung injury. These results suggest that older mice have a compromised antiviral defense, which could inform new therapeutic approaches for elderly patients with severe COVID-19.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.615557", "title": "A bifunctional snoRNA with separable activities in guiding rRNA 2'-O-methylation and scaffolding gametogenesis effectors", "authors": "Leroy, E.; Challal, D.; Pelletier, S.; Goncalves, C.; Menant, A.; Marchand, V.; Jaszczyszyn, Y.; van Dijk, E.; Naquin, D.; Andreani, J.; Motorin, Y.; PALANCADE, B.; Rougemaille, M.", "author_corresponding": "Mathieu Rougemaille", "author_corresponding_institution": "Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, Gif-sur-Yvette, France", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "molecular biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.615557.source.xml", "abstract": "Small nucleolar RNAs are non-coding transcripts that guide chemical modifications of RNA substrates and modulate gene expression at the epigenetic and post-transcriptional levels.

However, it is unknown how the organization of contractile myofibrillar networks, linked to their efficiency, is modified during aging. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), we assess myofibril size, shape, and connectivity across different muscle types in young and geriatric mice and humans. Regardless of skeletal muscle fiber type in mice, age was associated with increased myofibrillar connectivity, with 24 months of age, as compared to 3 months, displaying more sarcomere branches. Distinctive age-related trends in myofibril size and shape were observed among each muscle type. Notably, there was a decrease in myofibril circularity from 3 months of age to 24 months of age in the gastrocnemius muscles of mice, contrasting with an increase in circularity in the soleus muscles during the same time frame. Additionally, while the soleus myofibrils in an aged cohort had a higher cross-sectional area, a reduction was observed in the gastrocnemius muscles. Cardiac muscles displayed no changes in sarcomere connectivity from 3 months to 24 months, although myofibril circularity and cross-sectional area were increased during this time. In human vastus lateralis muscles, sarcomere branching was positively correlated with advanced age. However, there were no consistent changes in myofibril size or shape across a wide age range from 16 to 68 years old.

Here, we utilized whole-genome data to explore the evolutionary patterns and population structure across 45 P. pachyrhizi isolates collected from 1972 to 2017 from diverse geographic regions worldwide. We also characterized in-silico mating-type (MAT) genes of P. pachyrhizi, in the predicted proteome of three isolates, to investigate the sexual compatibility system. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis in P. pachyrhizi inferred two distinct evolutionary lineages structured on a temporal scale, with lineage Pp1 grouping isolates obtained from 1972 to 1994, while more recently collected isolates formed a second lineage, Pp2. We found high levels of genetic diversity in lineage Pp1, whereas lineage Pp2 exhibited a strong clonal genetic structure, with a significant lower diversity. The widespread propagation of P. pachyrhizi clonal spores across soybean-growing regions likely explains the absence of a large-scale spatial genetic structure within each lineage. Two independent isolates (TW72-1 and AU79-1) showed moderate levels of genetic admixture, suggesting potential somatic hybridization between the two P. pachyrhizi lineages. We observed no clear congruence between virulence levels of P. pachyrhizi isolates and their phylogenetic patterns. Our findings support a probable tetrapolar mating system in P. pachyrhizi. Taken together, our study offers new insights into the evolutionary history of P. pachyrhizi and demonstrates that multiple MAT genes are highly expressed during the later stages of soybean infection, suggesting their potential role in the formation of urediniospores within the life cycle of P. pachyrhizi.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe Asian Soybean Rust (ASR) disease, caused by basidiomycetes fungus P. pachyrhizi, represents a critical threat to soybean crops worldwide. With the recent availability of high-quality genome assemblies for P. pachyrhizi, we are committed to exploring the genetic diversity of this destructive pathogen. This study analyzed whole-genome resequencing data from P. pachyrhizi isolates collected over several decades in various geographic regions. We identified recent diversification patterns in P. pachyrhizi, with two major lineages. The origin of the two lineages is likely due to temporal shifts in the genetic structure of P. pachyrhizi. Additionally, we investigated the genes responsible for sexual compatibility, known as mating-type (MAT) genes. Transcriptome data indicated that MAT genes are actively expressed during the later stages of the P. pachyrhizi-soybean infection. We conclude that the evolutionary dynamic of P. pachyrhizi is shaped by divergent lineages, which exhibit varying levels of virulence on differential soybean lines containing ASR resistance genes.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616282", "title": "Gene-by-environment interactions and adaptive body size variation in mice from the Americas", "authors": "Mack, K.

Despite their short residence time, there is evidence of rapid climate adaptation, including shifts in body size and aspects of metabolism with latitude. Previous studies in this system have identified candidate genes for metabolic adaptation using selection scans, however, environmental variation in diet as well as GxE interactions affecting metabolism are likely important factors in shaping body mass variation in wild populations. Here, we investigate the role of the environment and GxE interactions in shaping adaptive phenotypic variation with an experimental manipulation of diet. Using new locally adapted inbred strains from North and South America, we evaluated response to a high-fat diet, finding that sex, strain, diet, and the interaction between strain and diet contribute significantly to variation in aspects of body size. We also found that transcriptional response to diet is largely strain-specific, indicating that GxE interactions affecting gene expression are pervasive. Next, we used crosses between strains from contrasting climates (New York x Brazil and New York x Florida) to characterize gene expression regulatory divergence on a standard breeder diet and on a high-fat diet. We found that gene regulatory divergence is often condition-specific, particularly for trans-acting changes. Finally, we find evidence for lineage-specific selection on cis-regulatory variation involved in diverse processes, including lipid metabolism.

Their complex olfactory system is believed to have evolved due to the expansion of a specialized olfactory subsystem and the associated clade of olfactory receptors. Specifically, ants exhibit specialized antennal hairs known as basiconic sensilla, whose neurons project to a distinctive cluster of numerous, small glomeruli in their antennal lobes. This adaptation is believed to be linked to their social lifestyle, enabling the detection of recognition cues like cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which are essential for nestmate recognition and maintaining colony cohesion. However, our understanding of the ant olfactory system remains incomplete, lacking evolutionary context and phylogenetic breadth, which leaves the complexity in their most recent common ancestor uncertain. We thus conducted a comparative study of neuroanatomical traits across the phylogeny of the Formicidae. Our findings reveal a common blueprint for the ant olfactory pathway, alongside lineage-specific adaptations. This highlights a dynamic evolution, particularly for the CHC-related subsystem. Ancestral trait reconstructions indicate that olfactory sophistication predates the most recent common ancestor of ants. Additionally, we found that the chemical complexity of species-specific recognition cues is associated with neuronal investment within the olfactory system. Lastly, behavioral experiments on anatomically divergent ant species show that, despite variation in neuroanatomical traits, ants consistently discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates. This suggests that the evolution of ants olfactory system integrates sensory adaptations to diverse chemical environments, facilitating communication, a key to social behaviors.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616438", "title": "Evolution of the non-visual and visual opsin gene repertoire in ray-finned fishes", "authors": "Policarpo, M.; Fogg, L.

We provide compelling evidence that visual and non-visual opsins co-evolve in ray-finned fishes, both in terms of copy numbers and selective pressures acting on their coding sequences, probably in response to the different photic environments they inhabit. Species that live in dim light or all in the dark (such as in caves or the deep sea) convergently reduced their visual and non-visual opsin gene repertoires, while polar species feature accelerated evolution in both. Fishes that rely on electroreception show a reduction in the number of visual and non-visual opsin genes and accelerated evolution of the remaining genes.

The TAC is crucial for mitochondrial genome segregation during cytokinesis. At the core of the TAC, the outer membrane protein TAC60 binds to the inner membrane protein p166, forming a permanent contact site between the two membranes. Although contact sites between mitochondrial membranes are common and serve various functions, their molecular architecture remains largely unknown. This study elucidates the interaction interface of the TAC60-p166 contact site. Using in silico, in vitro, and mutational in vivo analyses, we identified minimal binding segments between TAC60 and p166. The p166 binding site in TAC60 consists of a short kinked -helix that interacts with the C-terminal - helix of p166. Despite the presence of conserved charged residues in either protein, electrostatic interactions are not necessary for contact site formation. Instead, the TAC60-p166 interaction is driven by the hydrophobic effect, as converting conserved hydrophobic residues in either protein to hydrophilic amino acids disrupts the contact site.\n\nAuthor summaryMitochondria are surrounded by two membranes and essential for nearly all eukaryotes. Contact sites between the two membranes are important for mitochondrial function. However, most contact sites are dynamic making their molecular architecture challenging to study. The tripartite attachment complex (TAC) of parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei connects its compact mitochondrial genome with the basal body of the flagellum. This couples the segregation of the replicated mitochondrial genome to the old and new basal body. The TAC contains permanent contact sites formed by outer membrane protein TAC60 and the intermembrane space-exposed C-terminus of p166 of the inner membrane. We have used it as a model for a prototypical contact site. AlphaFold predictions and in vitro binding assays identified a small region in the intermembrane space region of TAC60 that binds p166 forming contact sites. In vivo expression of various TAC60 and/or p166 mutants followed by immunoprecipitations demonstrates that contact site formation is driven by the hydrophobic effect and independent of the conserved charged amino acids present at the TAC60-p166 interface. The TAC is unique to Kinetoplastids, understanding the molecular architecture of the TAC60-p166 contact site could therefore inform the development of drugs that disrupt this critical interaction.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616466", "title": "Molecular basis of autoimmune disease protection by MDA5 variants", "authors": "Singh, R.; Herrero del Valle, A.; Joiner, J.

Many MDA5 variants are associated with protection from autoimmune disease, while increasing the risk of infection and chronic inflammation, but how these variants affect MDA5-dependent RNA sensing remains unclear. Here, we determine the consequences of autoimmune-protective MDA5 variants on the molecular structure and activities of MDA5. The rare variants E627* and I923V reduce the cellular interferon response to picornavirus infection and are deficient in filament formation. The I923V variant is ATPase hyperactive, causing premature dissociation from dsRNA. Cryo-EM structures of MDA5 I923V bound to dsRNA at different stages of ATP hydrolysis reveal smaller RNA binding interfaces, leading to excessive proofreading activity. Variants R843H and T946A, which are genetically linked and cause mild phenotypes, have no effect on dsRNA recognition, suggesting an indirect disease mechanism. We conclude that the autoimmune-protective MDA5 variants lead to a loss of MDA5-dependent signaling via multiple distinct mechanisms.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.614057", "title": "Characterisation of RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT) using a small molecule approach", "authors": "Pearson, L.-A.; Petit, A.-P.; Mendoza-Martinez, C.; Bellany, F.; Lin, D.; Niven, S.; Swift, R.; Eadsforth, T.; Fyfe, P.

The Myb-bHLH-WDR (MBW) complex is a broadly-conserved transcriptional regulator affecting pigmentation, biotic stress resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance. We investigated the function of sorghum grain pigmentation regulator Tannin1, the ortholog of Arabidopsis pleiotropic WD40 regulator TTG1, to test for conserved pleiotropic regulatory effects and to better understand the evolution of the MBW complex in Poaceae. We characterized genome-wide differential expression of leaf tissue using RNA sequencing in near-isogenic lines (NILs) that contrasted wildtype Tan1 and loss-of-function tan1-b alleles, under optimal temperature and chilling stress. Notably, Gene Ontology analyses revealed no pathways with differential expression between Tan1 and tan1-b NILs, suggesting that, in contrast to Arabidopsis TTG1, Tannin1 has no pleiotropic regulatory role in leaves. Further, NILs had no visible difference in anthocyanin pigmentation, and no genes with known or expected function in flavonoid synthesis were differentially expressed. Genome-wide, only 18 total genes were differentially expressed between NILs, with six of these genes located inside the NIL introgression region, an observation most parsimoniously explained by cis-regulatory effects unrelated to Tannin1 regulation. Comparing our findings with known function of TTG1 orthologs in maize, rice, and Arabidopsis, we conclude that pleiotropic regulatory function in leaf tissue was likely lost in panicoid grass evolution before the sorghum-maize split.

Discovered in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in camels in the Middle East and is continually causing local outbreaks and epidemics. While all three newly emerging human CoV from past 20 years (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) cause respiratory disease, each CoV has unique host interactions that drive differential pathogeneses. To better understand the virus and host interactions driving lethal MERS-CoV infection, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics analysis of sublethal and lethal MERS-CoV infection in mice. Significant differences were observed in body weight loss, virus titers and acute lung injury among lethal and sub-lethal virus doses. Virus induced apoptosis of type I and II alveolar epithelial cells suggest that loss or dysregulation of these key cell populations was a major driver of severe disease. Omics analysis suggested differential pathogenesis was multi-factorial with clear differences among innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as those that regulate lung epithelial homeostasis. Infection of mice lacking functional T and B-cells showed that adaptive immunity was important in controlling viral replication but also increased pathogenesis. In summary, we provide a high-resolution host response atlas for MERS-CoV infection and disease severity. Multi-omics studies of viral pathogenesis offer a unique opportunity to not only better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease but also to identify genes and pathways that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention all of which is important for our future pandemic preparedness.\n\nImportanceEmerging coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV cause a range of disease outcomes in humans from asymptomatic, moderate and severe respiratory disease which can progress to death but the factors causing these disparate outcomes remain unclear. Understanding host responses to mild and life-threatening infection provides insight into virus-host networks within and across organ systems that contribute to disease outcomes. We used multi-omics approaches to comprehensively define the host response to moderate and severe MERS-CoV infection. Severe respiratory disease was associated with dysregulation of the immune response. Key lung epithelial cell populations that are essential for lung function get infected and die. Mice lacking key immune cell populations experienced greater virus replication but decreased disease severity implicating the immune system in both protective and pathogenic roles in the response to MERS-CoV.

Here, as part of investigations into how the N-terminal amino acids regulate translation, we serendipitously uncovered a new N-degron that revealed an additional layer of regulation in these pathways. Using reporter assays, we discovered that peptides bearing position 3 arginine or lysine residues at the N-terminus were rapidly degraded in mammalian cells. We found this pathway requires MetAP2, which co-translationally cleaves the N-terminal methionine preceding second position threonine and valines to initiate protein decay.

Here we show that UBR4 can specifically recognize position 3 Lys and Arg N-termini upon methionine removal by the methionine amino peptidase MetAP2. Accordingly, proteins that bear N-terminal residues that are processed by MetAP1 are unaffected by the loss or inhibition of MetAP2.

The HSAN-associated TECPR2 (R1336W) missense variant was deficient in Rab5-binding and, consequently, in membrane recruitment. TECPR2-depletion led to perinuclear collapse of recycling endosomes and increased overlap of sorting and degradative subdomain markers on early endosomes.

The dysregulation of TAG hydrolysis is involved in various metabolic diseases such as fatty liver disease (FLD). We previously demonstrated that ABHD5 interacted with PNPLA3, a closely related family member to PNPLA2. Importantly, a common missense variant in PNPLA3 (I148M) is the greatest genetic risk factor for FLD. PNPLA3 148M functions to sequester ABHD5 and prevent co-activation of PNPLA2, which has implications for initiating FLD; however, the exact mechanisms involved are not understood. Here we demonstrate that LD targeting of both ABHD5 and PNPLA3 I148M is required for the interaction. Molecular modeling demonstrates important resides in the C-terminus of PNPLA3 for LD binding and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy demonstrates that PNPLA3 I148M greater associates with ABHD5 than WT PNPLA3. Moreover, the C-terminus of PNPLA3 is sufficient for functional targeting of PNPLAs to LD and the interaction with ABHD5. In addition, ABHD5 is a general binding partner of LD-bound PNPLAs.

In this study, we present an integrated approach that combines tracking gas exchange between cyanobacteria and their environment with analysing the redox kinetics of the underlying photosynthetic electron transport chain. This combined system allows for real-time, simultaneous acquisition of respiration and photosynthesis data. For example, it enabled us to show that the electron transport rate generated by photosystem II, translated to in-vivo oxygen concentration, equals the actual concentration of oxygen produced by water splitting plus the amount of oxygen respired. We further demonstrate that our system can accurately assess light respiration in wild-type strains of cyanobacteria, which amounts to 1/10 of their photosynthetic activity under optimal growth conditions. This level of accuracy was previously achievable only with specific cyanobacteria mutants.

The latter poses a technical and economical challenge: high salt reaction conditions are essential for maintaining ribosome integrity but negatively impact the MNase activity, necessitating using large amounts of nuclease to achieve efficient cleavage. Here, we set out to generate an optimized production protocol for two forms of MNase -- fully processed MNaseA and the 19 amino acid propeptide-containing MNaseB -- and to biochemically benchmark them against a commercial nuclease.

Importantly, ribosome profiling experiments in the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii demonstrated that MNaseA produces ribosome footprints and hallmarks of active translation highly comparable to those obtained with the commercial nuclease, making it a suitable alternative for high-salt ribosome profiling applications.

In this study, we explored the incorporation of a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based linker into RNA-targeting probes to improve their affinity and specificity. By integrating a PNA linker into a small molecule probe of Riboglow platform, we enabled dual binding events: cobalamin (Cbl)-RNA structure-based recognition and sequence-specific PNA-RNA interaction. We show that incorporating a six-nucleotide PNA sequence complementary to the region of wild type RNA aptamer (env8) results in a 30-fold improvement in binding affinity compared to the probe with nonfunctional PEG linker. Even greater improvements are observed when the PNA probe was tested against truncated versions of the RNA aptamer, with affinity increasing by up to 280-fold. Additionally, the PNA linker is able to rescue Cbl-RNA interaction even when the cobalamin binding pocket is compromised. We demonstrated that PNA probes effectively bind RNA both in vitro and in live cells, enhancing visualization of RNA in stress granules and U-bodies at low concentrations. The modular nature of the Riboglow platform allows for flexible modifications of the PNA linker, fluorophore and RNA tag, while maintaining high specificity and affinity. This work establishes a new approach for enhancing RNA imaging platforms through the use of PNA linkers, highlighting the potential of combining short oligonucleotides with small molecules to improve the affinity and specificity of RNA-targeting probes.

Transcription is the primary determinate of cell-state and most cellular perturbations (e.g. disease, drug treatment, or abiotic stressors) impact transcription by altering the activity of polymerases. Thus, the ability to detect and quantify detailed changes in polymerase activity would yield considerable insight into most cellular processes. Nascent run-on sequencing assays provide a direct readout of polymerase activity, but no tools exist that comprehensively model this activity at genes. Thus, we focus on RNA polymerase II (RNAP2), which is responsible for transcribing all protein-coding genes and many ncRNAs. Here we present the first model to fully capture the complete process of gene transcription by RNAP2. For an individual gene, this model parameterizes each distinct stage of RNAP2 transcription-- Loading, Initiation, Elongation, and Termination, hence LIET--in a biologically interpretable way, and combines them in a Bayesian mixture model intended to be applied to nascent run-on sequencing data. Additionally, we provide a user-friendly, open-source software implementation of the model, which we use to demonstrate its performance. With our improved modeling of Loading and Initiation we demonstrate that these processes are characteristically different between sense (gene coding) and antisense (PROMPT) strands. Furthermore, our model is the first to robustly quantify the Termination phase of transcription. By applying the LIET model to 24 different human cell-types, our analysis indicates that the position of dissociation appears to be highly consistent across cell-types, indicative of a highly regulated process. Furthermore, by applying the LIET model to perturbation experiments, we demonstrate its ability to detect specific regulatory changes in pausing ratio (at 5'end), strand-bias, and dissociation location (at 3'end).

The lack of membranes also means that sensor designs and reaction optimizations can be screened in high throughput.

The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments to execute; we therefore implement design-of-experiments to optimize the information gained from each design-build-test-learn cycle. We used these approaches to first optimize the performance of a low-cost cell-free expression formulation that was initially non- functional when embedded in paper, then further optimize it for tolerance to exposure to heat.

The hosts innate response acts as the first line of defense, and CMV, like other viruses, has consequently evolved multiple mechanisms to manipulate host interferon (IFN) responses. DEAD-box Helicase 41 (DDX41) is an intracellular dsDNA sensor that, upon activation by Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK), triggers type I IFN production through the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling pathway. Here, we show the activation of this signaling pathway during lytic CMV infection, wherein BTK, DDX41, and STING are activated through tyrosine phosphorylation, and both DDX41 and BTK interact with STING. Further, CMV infection re-localizes DDX41 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it localizes to the perinuclear virus assembly compartment (vAC). Here, DDX41 phosphorylation is attenuated, suggesting cytoplasmic redistribution leads to a less active or inactive form. Additionally, DDX41 co-localizes in the vAC with the CMV tegument proteins, pp65 and pp71, each of which interact with DDX41 in immunoprecipitation assays. We further demonstrate the protective role of this signaling pathway, as treatment with the BTK inhibitor, orelabrutinib, attenuates DDX41 phosphorylation/activation and supports increased expression of viral proteins and virus replication. In sum, our work highlights the important role of BTK-DDX41-STING signaling in the innate immune response against CMV, which the virus subverts by attenuating its cytoplasmic activity, thereby diverting it from its typically protective function.\n\nImportanceHuman cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that poses a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals, highlighting the critical role of innate immunity in controlling this viral infection. Despite extensive research, the complex mechanisms underlying innate immunity against CMV and the viruss strategies for evading immune detection remain only partially understood. This study identifies the activation of the cellular BTK-DDX41-STING innate signaling axis during lytic CMV infection, which ultimately results in protective interferon responses. Our findings show that CMV infection triggers the cytoplasmic redistribution of the cellular protein, DDX41, leading to reduced phosphorylation and activity, thereby undermining its protective function. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of BTK enhances viral protein expression and replication, highlighting the importance of this pathway in immune defense. Our work identifies BTK- and DDX41-dependent STING signaling as important for innate immune responses against CMV and further advances our understanding of CMVs manipulation of these responses.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616540", "title": "Improved maximum growth rate prediction from microbial genomes by integrating phylogenetic information", "authors": "Xu, L.; Zakem, E.; Weissman, J.", "author_corresponding": "JL Weissman", "author_corresponding_institution": "Stony Brook University", "date": "2024-10-03", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/03/2024.10.03.616540.source.xml", "abstract": "Microbial maximum growth rates vary widely across species and are key parameters for ecosystem modeling.

At elevated temperature, only thermosensitive colonies showed a distinct shift in their microbiome, with an increase in Flavobacteriales, Rhodobacteraceae, and Vibrio, accompanying a marked bleaching response.

The relative toxicity of dissolved arsenic is related to its speciation, with As(V) being less toxic than As(III). Microorganisms have various mechanisms of arsenic resistance, including efflux and methylation. Microorganisms may also perform reduction/oxidation of As(V)/As(III) as part of their detoxification and/or metabolic pathways. We characterized the microbial communities along two aquifer transects associated with thermally mobilized arsenic near Northeastern Alberta oil sands deposits. 16S rRNA amplicons and metagenomic sequencing data of biomass from filtered groundwater indicated major changes in the dominant taxa between wells, especially those currently experiencing elevated arsenic concentrations. Annotation of arsenic-related genes indicated that efflux pumps (arsB, acr3), intracellular reduction (arsC) and methylation (arsM) genes were widespread amongst community members but comparatively few organisms encoded genes for arsenic respiratory reductases (arrA) and oxidases (arxA, aioA). While this indicates that microbes have the capacity to exacerbate arsenic toxicity by increasing the relative concentration of As(III), some populations of iron oxidizing and sulfate reducing bacteria (including novel Gallionella and Thermodesulfovibrionia populations) show potential for indirect bioremediation through formation of insoluble iron/sulfide minerals which adsorb or coprecipitate arsenic. An unusually high proportional abundance of a single Paceibacteria population that lacked arsenic resistance genes was identified in one high-arsenic well, and we discuss hypotheses for its ability to persist.

Compared to chemical inducers, light-dependent control of gene expression by optogenetics achieves a higher spatial and temporal resolution. This could also prove decisive beyond basic research for manufacturing difficult-to-express proteins in pharmaceutical bioproduction. However, current optogenetic gene-expression systems limit this application in mammalian cells as expression levels and fold induction upon light stimulation are not sufficient. To overcome this limitation, we designed a photoswitch by fusing the blue light-activated light-oxygen-voltage receptor EL222 from Erythrobacter litoralis to the three tandem transcriptional activator domains VP64, p65, and Rta. The resultant photoswitch, dubbed DEL-VPR, allows an up to 400-fold induction of target gene expression by blue light, achieving expression levels that surpass those for strong constitutive promoters. Here, we utilized DEL-VPR to enable light-induced expression of complex monoclonal and bispecific antibodies with reduced byproduct expression, increasing the yield of functional protein complexes.

Studies of old virus sequences have mainly relied on DNA or on RNA from fixed or frozen samples. The millions of specimens in natural history museums represent a potential treasure trove of old virus sequences, but it is not clear how well RNA survives in old samples. Here, we first experimentally assessed the stability of RNA in insects stored dry at room temperature over 72 weeks. Although RNA molecules grew increasingly fragmented, RNA yields remained surprisingly constant and RT-qPCR of host and virus RNA showed minimal differences between dried and frozen specimens. Next, we acquired Drosophila specimens from North American entomological collections to assess RNA survival in much older samples. We recovered sequences from known and novel viruses including several coding complete virus genomes from a fly collected in 1908. We found that the virome of D. melanogaster has changed little over the past century. Galbut virus, the most prevalent virus infection in contemporary D. melanogaster, was also the most common in historic samples. Finally, we investigated the genomic and physical features of surviving RNA. RNA that survived was fragmented, chemically damaged, and apparently protected by RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. We followed careful protocols to limit contamination from contemporary nucleic acid, and numerous lines of evidence support the conclusion that our results are based on sample-derived sequences.

CHR11 binds to transgenes prone to trigger PTGS. Knocking down CHR11 and its paralog CHR17 strongly reduces transgene PTGS, suggesting that SGS3 recruitment by CHR11/17 facilitates PTGS initiation. CHR11 is also enriched at endogenous protein-coding genes (PCGs) producing nat-siRNAs and va-siRNAs under biotic or abiotic stresses, and this production is reduced in chr11 chr17 double mutants at genome-wide level. Moreover, impairing CHR11 and CHR17 rescues the lethal phenotype caused by the massive production of siRNAs from PCGs in RQC-deficient mutants.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether bone osteolysis is driven by early changes in the bone mechanical environment during metastasis by (a) implementing subject-specific FE models of metastatic femora to predict the mechanical environment within bone tissue during early metastasis (3-weeks after tumour inoculation) and then (b) applying mechanoregulation theory to predict bone tissue remodelling as a function of the evolving mechanical environment within bone tissue during breast cancer-bone metastasis. We implemented a global resorption rate derived from an experimental model, but the mechanoregulation algorithm predicted localised bone loss in the greater trochanter region, the same region where osteolysis was prevalent after three weeks of metastasis development in the animal model. Moreover, the mechanical environment evolved in a similar manner to that reported in separate subject-specific finite element models of these same animals by 6 weeks.

Offset analgesia (OA) describes the large decrease in perceived pain in response to a minor decrease in applied painful thermal stimulus.

Paired-pulse TMS at peri-threshold intensity elicits short-latency intracortical facilitation (SICF) with early peaks at inter-pulse intervals of 1.0-1.8ms (SICF1) and 2.4-3ms (SICF2). The similarity between the periodicity of SICF and indirect (I-)waves in the corticospinal volleys evoked by single-pulse TMS suggests that SICF originates from I-wave generating circuits. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of MEP generation by mapping the corticomotor representations of single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS targeting SICF1 and SICF2 peaks in 14 participants (7 female). MEPs were recorded from two hand muscles and the spatial properties of each corticomotor map were analyzed. For both hand muscles, we found a consistent posterior shift of the center-of-gravity (CoG) for SICF maps compared to single-pulse maps, with a larger shift for SICF1. CoG displacement in the SICF1 map correlated with individual SICF1 latencies. Further, ADM maps consistently peaked more medially than FDI maps and paired-pulse TMS resulted in larger corticomotor maps than single-pulse TMS. This is the first study to show that circuits responsible for SICF have a more posterior representation in the precentral crown than those generating MEPs via single-pulse TMS. These findings indicate that paired-pulse TMS probing SICF1, SICF2, and single-pulse TMS engage overlapping but spatially distinct cortical circuits, adding further insights into the intricate organization of the human motor hand area.\n\nNew & NoteworthySingle- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used to study corticomotor physiology in humans, but do they engage the same intracortical circuits?

Since then, there have been several spillover events to cats, poultry, and humans. Multiple reports have discovered infectious virus in raw milk from infected dairy cows. Infectious virus can also last over a period on milking machine surfaces as a potential route of spread in cattle and contamination in raw milk. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared commercial pasteurized milk as safe for consumption given the lack of infectious virus, there have been numerous reports that up to 30 percent of commercial milk tested were positive for HPAI H5N1 influenza virus genome copies. This is not necessarily unique to the HPAI H5N1 virus, as retrospective studies have identified H1N1 and H3N2 seropositivity in cows linked to decreased milk production. However, it is unknown how repeat exposure to the remaining viral proteins and genomic material in pasteurized milk modulates immune responses once ingested. We developed a successful in-house pasteurization protocol that inactivated high viral loads of the pandemic H1N1 strain A/California/04/2009 (Cal09) or bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 (A/bovine/Ohio.B24OSU-439/2024) viruses in raw milk.

We found that repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus was not sufficient to prevent or accelerate mortality from lethal challenge of HPAI H5N1, though it did result in a [~]0.5 log10 reduction viral titers in the brain and delayed clinical signs. In contrast, oral gavage of mice with pre-existing immunity to H1N1 influenza virus with virus pasteurized in milk were protected from morbidity and mortality upon bovine H5N1 viral challenge.

As a result, in simulations of the leaf canopies of grain crops such as maize and sorghum, this trait is frequently approximated as alternating 180{degrees} angles between sequential leaves. We explore the feasibility of extracting direct measurements of the phyllotaxy of sequential leaves from 3D reconstructions of individual sorghum plants generated from 2D calibrated images and test the assumption of consistently alternating phyllotaxy across a diverse set of sorghum genotypes. Using a voxel-carving-based approach, we generate 3D reconstructions from multiple calibrated 2D images of 366 sorghum plants representing 236 sorghum genotypes from the sorghum association panel. The correlation between automated and manual measurements of phyllotaxy is only modestly lower than the correlation between manual measurements of phyllotaxy generated by two different individuals.

While extensive research has explored this relationship, there remains a lack of studies specifically examining the statistical correlation between psychotic brain networks using high-order networks, considering the limitations of loworder networks.

However, our understanding of how these imbalances give rise to specific psychotic symptoms remains limited.\n\nMethodsThis study aims to address this gap by investigating variations at the topological high-order level of the system with regard to specialization in both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Employing graph-theoretic brain network analysis, we systematically examine restingstate functional MRI data to delineate system-level distinctions in the connectivity patterns of brain networks.\n\nResultsThe findings indicate that topological high-order functional connectomics highlight differences in the connectome between healthy controls and schizophrenia, demonstrating increased cingulo-opercular task control and salience interactions, while the interaction between subcortical and default mode networks, dorsal attention and sensory/somatomotor mouth decreases in schizophrenia.

The definition of the molecular basis of its development and the oncogenic signals driving lethality continue to be important objectives in prostate cancer research. Prior work from others and us has demonstrated that loss of PGC1 expression results in a metabolic, signaling and transcriptional reprogramming that supports the development of metastatic disease. However, we do not fully understand the spectrum of tumor suppressive effects regulated by this co-regulator. Here we show that PGC1 governs non-cell autonomous paracrine tumor suppression in prostate cancer. A systematic analysis of the transcriptional landscapes associated to PGC1 loss of expression revealed that PGC1 alters the expression of genes encoding for secreted proteins. Cell secretome studies corroborated that PGC1-dependent ERR regulation in prostate cancer cells suppresses the growth of tumor cells exposed to their conditioned media. The integration of in vitro and in vivo secretomics data and genetic perturbation assays revealed spermidine synthase as a transcriptional target of PGC1 and mediator of a paracrine metabolic growth suppressive effect. Moreover, the activity of the regulatory axis PGC1-ERR-SRM was reflected in patients and had prognostic value. Altogether, this work provides unprecedented evidence of the non-cell autonomous tumor suppression role of PGC1, which broadens the view of this co-regulator as a multifactorial tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616520", "title": "Same bi-directional modulation of contrast appearance for voluntary presaccadic attention and involuntary exogenous attention", "authors": "Zhang, T.; Cai, Y.-C.", "author_corresponding": "Yong-Chun Cai", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Zhejiang University", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.10.03.616520.source.xml", "abstract": "Different types of attention alter subjective visual perception in fundamentally distinct ways.

Here we find that a class of transcriptional regulators previously associated with regulation of development in Caenorhabditis elegans, is also involved in immune responses. Specifically, through forward genetics, we find that loss of lin-15B leads to constitutive expression of Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR) genes. lin-15B encodes a transcriptional repressor with a conserved THAP domain that is associated with the DRM chromatin remodeling complex that regulates C. elegans development. We show that lin-15B mutants have increased resistance to natural intracellular pathogens, and the induction of IPR genes in lin-15B mutants relies on the MES-4 histone methyltransferase. We extend our analyses to other DRM and NuRD chromatin remodeling factors, as well as SUMOylation histone modifiers, showing that a broad range of chromatin-related factors can repress IPR gene expression.

Through forward genetic screens, we found that loss of LIN-15B leads to constitutive activation of Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR) genes. LIN-15B is part of the DREAM chromatin remodeling complex, and its loss enhances resistance to intracellular pathogens. This immune response depends on the MES-4 histone methyltransferase.

We demonstrate that disturbed shear stress significantly reduces Aff3ir-ORF2 expression in athero-prone regions. Using three distinct mouse models with manipulated AFF3ir-ORF2 expression, we demonstrate that AFF3ir-ORF2 exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in ApoE-/- mice.

AFF3ir-ORF2 interacts with IRF5, promoting its retention in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the IRF5-dependent inflammatory pathways. Notably, IRF5 knockdown in AFF3ir-ORF2 deficient mice almost completely rescues the aggravated atherosclerotic phenotype. Moreover, endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 supplementation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system significantly ameliorated endothelial activation and atherosclerosis.

Such variability is not attributed to heterogeneity in auxin perception, but to downstream stochastic expression of DR5, mainly influenced by cell-intrinsic molecular noise. Expression of AHP6 and DOF5.8 is also noisy, although their noise is lower and has distinct spatiotemporal patterns unlike DR5. Finally, we propose spatial averaging as a mechanism that buffers cellular gene expression noise, allowing the formation of robust global expression patterns.

Using generalised linear mixed models, we find that current local (village-level) dog rabies incidence decreases with increasing recent local vaccination coverage. However, current local incidence is most dependent on recent incidence, both locally and in the wider district, consistent with high population connectivity. Removing the masking effects of prior non-local incidence shows that, for the same average prior vaccination coverage beyond the focal village, more spatial variation increases local incidence. These effects led to outbreaks following years when vaccination campaigns missed many villages, whereas when heterogeneity in coverage was reduced, incidence declined to low levels (<0.4 cases/1,000 dogs annually and no human deaths), such that short vaccination lapses thereafter did not lead to resurgence. We inferred ongoing rabies incursions into the district, suggesting regional connectivity as an important source of residual transmission.

All show comparable general patterns of outlier expression. Different individuals can harbor very different numbers of outliers, with some individuals showing extreme numbers in only one out of several organs of the respective individual. A three-generation family analysis in mice was generated and analyzed for the inheritance of outlier patterns. We find that most extreme over-expressions are not inherited, i.e., appear to be sporadically generated in individuals. Still, co-regulated outlier expressions are identifiable in various gene groups, and some correspond with known pathways. Among the co-regulated genes with extreme outlier expression are also the hormone genes prolactin and growth hormone, both in mice and humans, for which we include also protein level data from human cohorts.\n\nConclusionsWe show that outlier patterns of gene expression are a biological reality occurring universally across tissues and species.

Allelic imbalance is also of scientific and, potentially, clinical interest as it can erode the degree to which the effects of deleterious variants are buffered in a diploid organism and has been reported to be associated with the penetrance of pathological genomic variants. Here, we develop and apply a statistical model that is designed to evaluate whether the genotype of a locus is associated with the degree of allelic imbalance of a gene and refer to such loci as allelic imbalance quantitative trait loci (aiQTLs). An advantage of our approach is that it does not depend on link-age disequilibrium between the aiQTL and the associated gene and is, therefore, suited to the identification of eQTLs that act in cis over very large distances. We applied our model to data from the GTEx consortium and report, for the first time, the relationship between the distance of an eQTL from the TSS of the associated gene and the evidence that the eQTL acts in cis. Previous studies have used a distance of 1Mb from the target gene as an indication that an eQTL acts in cis; however, our results suggest that the majority of eQTLs at distances more than 500kb from the TSS of the target gene are likely to act in trans (and thus to affect both gene copies). The model used here is also well suited to comparing the overall extent of allelic imbalance between samples. We show that in some tissues allelic imbalance is correlated with age; however, this correlation may be due to changes in the abundance of immune cell populations with age, as we found strong correlations between sample-level allelic imbalance and the inferred abundance of multiple immune cell types across whole blood samples.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616478", "title": "3D mechanical confinement directs muscle stem cell fate and function", "authors": "Park, G.; Grey, J.

This study investigates how three-dimensional (3D) confinement and stiffness encountered by MuSCs during the later stages of regeneration regulate their function, including stemness, activation, proliferation, and differentiation. We engineered an asymmetric 3D hydrogel bilayer platform with tunable physical constraints to mimic the regenerating MuSC niche. Our results demonstrate that increased 3D confinement maintains Pax7 expression, reduces MuSC activation and proliferation, inhibits differentiation, and is associated with smaller nuclear size and decreased H4K16ac levels, suggesting that mechanical confinement modulates both nuclear architecture and epigenetic regulation. MuSCs in unconfined two-dimensional (2D) environments exhibited larger nuclei and higher H4K16ac expression compared to those in more confined 3D conditions, leading to progressive activation, expansion, and myogenic commitment. This study highlights the importance of 3D mechanical cues in MuSC fate regulation, with 3D confinement acting as a mechanical brake on myogenic commitment, offering novel insights into the mechano-epigenetic mechanisms that govern MuSC behavior during muscle regeneration.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616533", "title": "Computational design and evaluation of optimal bait sets for scalable proximity proteomics", "authors": "Kasmaeifar, V.; Sedighi, S.; Gingras, A.-C.; Campbell, K.

Because a universal biomarker for CS has yet to be identified, combinations of senescence-associated biomarkers linked to various biological stress responses including lysosomal activity ({beta}-galactosidase staining), inflammation (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs), and apoptosis (senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways) are used to identify senescent cells.\n\nUsing in vitro human bulk RNA-seq datasets, we find that senescent states enrich for various stress responses in a cell-type, temporal, and insult-dependent manner.

We attribute this limitation to the optimization goals in classification, which tend to focus solely on the most representative features--an approach that is particularly inefficient for WSIs with gigapixel resolution.

Importantly, most proteins adopt multiple conformations with non-trivial ensemble distributions that change depending on their environment to perform functions like catalysis, signaling, and transport. Recently, machine learning techniques, especially deep generative models, have been employed to develop protein conformation generators. These models, known as unified protein ensemble samplers, are trained on the PDB dataset and can generate diverse protein conformation ensembles given a protein sequence. However, their reliance solely on structural data from the PDB, which primarily captures folded protein states, restricts the diversity of the generated ensembles and can result in physically unrealistic conformations. In this paper, we overcome these challenges by introducing EGDiff, an experiment-guided diffusion model for protein conformation generation. EGDiff integrates experimental measurements as a physical prior, enabling the generation of protein conformations with desired properties. Our experiments on a variety of fast-folding and intrinsically disordered proteins demonstrate that EGDiff significantly advances the capabilities of current unified protein ensemble samplers. With little computational cost, EGDiff can capture important proteins configuration properties and the underlying Boltzmann distribution, paving the way for a next-generation molecular dynamics engine. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of EGDiff to capture conformational changes in the presence of mutations and as an efficient tool for determining a reasonable CV space for protein ensembles. With these results, EGDiff is well-poised to push the study of protein ensembles into a data-rich regime currently available to few problems in biology.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616471", "title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue identified multi-ciliary cells in breast cancer", "authors": "Gonzalez-Martinez, S.; Carretero-Barrio, I.; Perez-Mies, B.; Fernandez-Lanza, V.; Garcia-Cosio, M.; Caniego-casas, T.; Hardisson, D.; Estaban-Rodriguez, I.; Cortes, J.; Palacios, J.", "author_corresponding": "Jose Palacios", "author_corresponding_institution": "Ramon y Cajal University Hospital", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "cancer biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.10.04.616471.source.xml", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and fixed fresh (FF) samples for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).

Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) is a critical redox rheostat that regulates oxidative stress responses, and its deletion is known to accelerate muscle atrophy and weakness during aging (sarcopenia) or denervation. Conversely, pharmacologic activation of NRF2 extends mouse lifespan and attenuates sarcopenia. Similarly, deletion of Kelch-like ECH-associated Protein 1 (Keap1), negative regulator of NRF2, enhances exercise capacity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether muscle-specific Keap1 deletion is sufficient to prevent muscle atrophy and weakness in mice following 7-days of hindlimb unloading (HU). To test this hypothesis, control (Ctrl) and tamoxifen inducible, muscle-specific Keap1 knockout (mKO) mice were subjected to either normal housing (Sham) or HU for 7 days. Activation of NRF2 in muscle was confirmed by increased mRNA of NRF2 targets thioredoxin 1 (Txn1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) in mKO mice. Keap1 deletion had an effect to increase force-generating capacity at baseline. However, muscle masses, cross sectional area, and ex vivo force were not different between mKO and Ctrl HU mice. In addition, muscle 4-hydroxynonenal-modified proteins and protein carbonyls were unaffected by Keap1 deletion. These data suggest NRF2 activation improves muscle force production during ambulatory conditions but is not sufficient prevent muscle atrophy or weakness following 7-days of HU.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616570v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15747ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12f22c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19308ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@273b5a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.615866", "title": "A multi-omics census reveals obesity-associated microRNA miR-let-7 as novel instigator of adipose mitochondrial dysfunction and of intergenerational metabolic decline.", "authors": "Huang, C.; Park, J.-H.; Altintas, A.; Stanic, N.; Batarlar, H.

Herein, we present a novel strategy for assembling long L-RNAs via the joining of two or more shorter fragments using cross-chiral ligase ribozymes together with new substrate activation chemistry. We show that 5'-monophosphorylated L-RNA, which is readily prepared by solid phase synthesis, can be activated by chemical attachment of a 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or diphosphate (ADP), yielding 5'-adenosyl (di-or tri-) phosphate L-RNA. The activation reaction is performed in mild aqueous conditions, proceeds efficiently with short or large L-RNA, and, yielding few biproducts, requires little or no further purification after activation. Importantly, both groups, when added to L-RNA, are compatible with ribozyme-mediated ligation, with the 5'-adenosyl triphosphate permitting rapid and efficient joining of multiple, long L-RNA strands. This is exemplified by the assembly of a 129-nt L-RNA molecule via a single cross-chiral ligation event. Overall, by relying on ribozymes that can be readily prepared by in vitro transcription and L-RNA substrates that can be activated through simple chemistry, these methods are expected to make long L-RNAs more accessible to a wider range of researchers and facilitate the expansion of L-ON-based technologies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616532", "title": "Design of bacterial DNT sensors based on computational models", "authors": "Bahiri Elitzur, S.; Shpigel, E.; Katzir, I.; Alon, U.; Belkin, S.; Tuller, T.", "author_corresponding": "Tamir Tuller", "author_corresponding_institution": "Tel Aviv University", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "synthetic biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.10.04.616532.source.xml", "abstract": "Detecting explosive compounds such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and its volatile byproduct 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) is paramount for public health and environmental safety.

However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and does not incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms.

In this study, we investigated how the VPC processes temporal information during a time interval comparison task (TICT) and a time interval categorization task (TCT) in primates. We found a notable heterogeneity in neuronal responses associated with time perception across both tasks. While most neurons responded during time interval presentation, a smaller subset retained this information during the working memory periods.

During delay periods, these categorical or parametric representations remained consistent within each task context.

Depending on the task, the brain encodes time either categorically (\"long\" or \"short\") or as precise intervals.

We examined neuroinflammatory markers plasma YKL-40 and GFAP, due to previous conflicting evidence relating YKL-40 and GFAP to AD pathogenic markers.\n\nDesignCross-sectional data from a community observational study (Biomarker Exploration in Aging, Cognition, and Neurodegeneration - BEACoN) were included.\n\nSettingAll participants were enrolled in a single site, at University of California, Irvine.\n\nParticipants126 participants were included if they had at least one of the following measures available: neuropsychological data, MRI, A{beta}-PET, or plasma.\n\nExposuresPlasma YKL-40 and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels.\n\nMain outcomes and measuresWhite matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, 18F-florbetapir (FBP) PET mean SUVR, plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau-217) concentration, MTL cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, and memory function assessed by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.

Further, higher plasma GFAP, WMH and FBP SUVR were independently associated with increased pTau-217. In turn, plasma pTau-217 was associated with reduced MTL cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. Subsequently, only reduced hippocampal volume was related to lower memory function.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceNeuroinflammatory markers contribute to parallel pathways of cerebrovascular injury and A{beta}, which converge to tau-associated neurodegeneration and memory deficits in older adults.

The other involves plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and its impact on A{beta} deposition measured via 18F-florbetapir (FBP) PET. Both pathways converged on tauopathy, measured by plasma pTau-217, which was associated with lower medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortical thickness and hippocampal volume, and consequently, memory deficits.\n\nMeaningInflammation acts on Alzheimers disease mechanisms via multiple distinct and parallel pathways which converge downstream onto neurodegeneration.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616579v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b7bf4corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@703328org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e8751org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b5fad6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Credit: BioRender was used to help create this graphical abstract.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616486", "title": "Multisensory gamma stimulation enhances adult neurogenesis and improves cognitive function in a mouse model of Down syndrome", "authors": "Islam, M.

The relationship between the extent of injury potentials and spinal cord injury (SCI) progression, as well as the potential pharmacological modulation of the immediate consequences of a trauma, have not yet been explored. To limit the peak of injury potentials and speed up recovery of reflex motor responses, we serially applied selective neurochemicals in the exact moment of an experimental physical trauma delivered through a calibrated device impacting the mid-thoracic cord of an entire CNS preparation of neonatal rats. Continuous lumbar root recordings monitored baseline DC-levels and reflex responses elicited by trains of electric pulses applied to sacrocaudal afferents. In uninjured preparations, each agent showed distinct effects on baseline polarization, modulation of synaptic responses, and appearance of bursting activity. Interestingly, neurochemicals acting on glutamatergic-, adenosinergic-, glycinergic- or GABAergic receptors, did not affect the monitored outcome when each parameter was normalized against pre-injury values. Conversely, the selective TRPV4 antagonist, RN1734, unlike the TRPA1 antagonist, AP18, reduced peak of injury potentials and speeded up full recovery of reflex responses within 1 min from trauma. Similarly, blockage of gap junctions quickly, yet partially, restored motor reflexes, while antagonism of GABAA receptors restored full reflexes, though slightly later.

By defining a  mirror-symmetry index, we quantitatively assess the symmetry in these connectomes, revealing a significant level of bilateral symmetry alongside notable asymmetry. Our approach also incorporates measures including connectivity similarity, motif-fingerprint differences, and path-compensation index to evaluate the networks functional redundancy and its capacity to compensate for unilateral disturbances. Here we show the C. elegans connectomes robust bilateral symmetry, which not only facilitates similar functions across neuron pairs but also ensures resilience against disruptions. This redundancy is not confined to symmetrical connections; it also includes asymmetric ones, adding to the neural networks complexity. An in-depth analysis into different neuron types shows varied redundancy levels: high in interneurons, moderate in motor neurons, and low in sensory neurons. This pattern suggests a strategic neural design where diverse inputs from sensory neurons, coupled with the stable integration by interneurons, lead to coordinated actions through motor neurons.

We demonstrate these principles in a model of the mouse spinal cord, where networks are constructed by probabilistic sampling of synaptic connections from cell-specific projection patterns, which are gleaned from literature3,4. The cell-type distributions are derived from single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial transcriptomics5.

This evidence is further supported by recent work showing that preoptic glutamatergic neurons are activated during microarousals that fragment sleep in response to stress, and optogenetic stimulation of these neurons promotes microarousals and wakefulness. Thus, while the wake-promoting function of MLPO_VGLUT2 is clear, their role in sleep homeostasis has not been assessed. We tested the hypothesis that MLPO_VGLUT2 are wake-active, and their activation will increase wakefulness and disrupt sleep homeostasis via projections to arousal-promoting systems. Using fiber photometry, we found that MLPO_VGLUT2 were highly active during REMs, wakefulness and brief arousals, and remained minimally active during NREMs. Chemogenetic stimulation of MLPO_VGLUT2 inhibited REMs onset and suppressed the REMs homeostatic response after total sleep deprivation. Chemogenetic inhibition of MLPO_VGLUT2 increased REMs time (during the light phase only) but did not influence REMs and NREMs homeostasis. Anterograde projection mapping revealed that MLPO_VGLUT2 innervate central regions that promote wakefulness and inhibit REMs. We conclude that MLPO_VGLUT2 powerfully suppress REMs and that exogenous --and possibly pathologic-- activation of these neurons disrupts REMs recovery, presumably by directly or indirectly activating REMs-inhibitory mechanisms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe preoptic area of the hypothalamus has been extensively studied and its role in sleep regulation is well-established. Importantly, recent work identified a group of preoptic glutamatergic neurons (MLPO_VGLUT2) that are wake-active and promote wakefulness. However, whether these neurons influence sleep homeostasis remains unknown. We demonstrate that MLPO_VGLUT2 are maximally active during REM sleep (REMs), wakefulness and brief arousals from sleep, and innervate wake-promoting and REMs-inhibitory regions. MLPO_VGLUT2 stimulation inhibits REMs and REMs rebound after sleep deprivation, whereas their inactivation increases REMs but does not alter REMs homeostatic response. We thus identified a preoptic mechanism that powerfully suppresses REMs, which we propose may engage during normal sleep-to-wake transitions to block REMs intrusions into subsequent wakefulness.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616501", "title": "Finding Agreement: fMRI-hyperscanning reveals that dyads explore in mental state space to align opinions.", "authors": "Speer, S.

Dyads (N=60) discussed pressing societal problems while being instructed to either persuade their partner or compromise with each other. Our analysis uncovered three key insights: First, individuals instructed to compromise rather than persuade tended to agree more at the end of the session. Second, hyperscanning and linguistic analyses revealed that encouraging compromise resulted in increased exploration during conversations; dyads given compromise instructions traversed more diverse mental states and topics. Third, heightened exploration was linked to greater eventual agreement. Notably, the effect of the compromise instruction on agreement was entirely mediated by the degree of exploration.

We hypothesized that the susceptibility of Apoe-/- HC mice might arise from an unrestrained feed-forward loop in which production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) stimulates production of type I interferons by pDCs which in turn leads to the recruitment and activation of more neutrophils, and demonstrated that depleting neutrophils, depleting plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), or blocking type I interferon signaling, improved the outcome of infection. In concordance with these results, we found that Mtb-infected in Apoe-/-HC mice produce high levels of LTB4 and 12-HETE, two eicosanoids known to act as neutrophil chemoattractants and showed that blocking leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor signaling also improved the outcome of tuberculosis. While production of NETs has been associated with severe tuberculosis in other mouse models and in humans, a causative role for NETs in the pathology has not been directly established.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) target the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface, can neutralize a broad range of the highly diverse circulating HCV strains and are essential tools to inform vaccine design. However, bNAbs targeting a single E1E2 epitope might be limited in neutralization breadth, which can be enhanced by using combinations of bNAbs that target different envelope epitopes. We have generated 60 IgG-like bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that can simultaneously target two distinct epitopes on E1E2. We combine non-overlapping E1E2 specificities into three types of bsAbs, each containing a different hinge length. The bsAbs show retained or increased potency and breadth against a diverse panel of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) and HCV produced in cell culture (HCVcc) compared to monospecific and cocktail controls. Additionally, we demonstrate that changes in the hinge length of bsAbs can alter the binding stoichiometry to E1E2.

Warming treatments elevated atmospheric temperatures by 1.2 and 3.3 {degrees}C (passive and active warming), respectively, but did not affect soil temperatures. Nevertheless, soils in the active warming treatment exhibited significantly lower water content than ambient conditions. Overall, soil bacterial diversity and richness (June, July, and August data combined) under the warming (passive and active) treatments and ambient controls did not demonstrate significant differences after two years of experimental warming. However, significantly higher bacterial evenness and diversity under warming treatments were observed in the early growing season (June).

NHEJ involves minimal end-processing and drives direct ligation of the broken ends, while HR first requires a DSB resection step that degrades 5 strands to generate 3 ssDNA tails necessary for homology search. When HR fails, an alternative end-joining pathway involving polymerase theta can serve as a backup repair mechanism by annealing and ligating microhomologies present in ssDNA tails on either side of a resected DSB. Resection is the early step that commits a DSB to repair by HR, and is therefore considered a prerequisite for TMEJ as well. It has been proposed that the exonuclease EXO1 and the helicase/nuclease complex of BLM-DNA2 have redundant roles in resection, and therefore may both contribute to TMEJ. Here, we use a sensitive deep-sequencing approach to identify DSB repair outcomes at an endogenous locus in response to genetic and chemical perturbation of the resection machinery. While we observe that both EXO1 and BLM-DNA2 contribute to resection, our findings highlight a predominant role for BLM-DNA2 in facilitating TMEJ. However, careful cell cycle analysis revealed that BLM-DNA primarily contributes to TMEJ by ensuring normal progression to the G2/M transition, required for TMEJ to become activated.

To promote its replication, Leishmania relies on a panoply of strategies to acquire macromolecules such as lipids from host macrophages. In this study, we have evaluated the role of VAPA, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident membrane protein involved in inter-organellar lipid transport, in macrophages infected with L. amazonensis. Following infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages with metacyclic L. amazonensis promastigotes, we observed that VAPA gradually associates with communal parasitophorous vacuoles. Knockdown of VAPA prevented the replication of L. amazonensis, which was accompanied by an impaired parasitophorous vacuole expansion. Using fluorescent ceramide, we established that VAPA is required for the transport of sphingolipids to the parasitophorous vacuoles and for its acquisition by L. amazonensis amastigotes. Proximity-ligation and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that L. amazonensis hijacks VAPA by disrupting its interactions with the lipid transfer proteins CERT and ORP1L. Finally, we found that VAPA is essential for the transfer of the Leishmania virulence glycolipid lipophosphoglycan from the parasitophorous vacuoles to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum. We propose that VAPA contributes to the ability of L. amazonensis to colonize macrophages by mediating bi-directional transfer of lipids essential for parasite replication and virulence between the parasitophorous vacuoles and the host cell endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe protozoan parasite Leishmania amazonensis replicates in macrophages, within communal parasitophorous vacuoles. To satisfy its various auxotrophies, this parasite must obtain macronutrients and metabolites from its host cell, including lipids. To salvage host sphingolipids, we obtained evidence that L. amazonensis exploits a macrophage nonvesicular lipid transport mechanism that requires the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein VAPA. Moreover, we found that VAPA is also required for the transfer of the Leishmania virulence glycolipid lipophosphoglycan from the parasitophorous vacuole to the macrophage endoplasmic reticulum. The fact that VAPA is essential for L. amazonensis to colonize macrophages is consistent with the central role that VAPA plays in mediating bi-directional transfer of lipids and illustrates the importance of the host cell endoplasmic reticulum in this host-parasite interaction.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616601", "title": "EASI-ORC: A Pipeline for the Efficient Analysis and Segmentation of smFISH Images for Organelle-RNA Colocalization Measurements in Yeast", "authors": "Garin, S.; Levavi, L.; Gerst, J.

Recent findings of ectopic expression of LEC markers including Prospero Homeobox 1 (PROX1), a master regulator of lymphatic differentiation, and the vascular permeability marker Plasmalemma Vesicle Associated Protein (PLVAP), in certain glioblastoma and brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), has prompted investigation into their roles in cerebrovascular malformations, tumor environments, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) abnormalities. To explore the relationship between ectopic LEC properties and BBB disruption, we utilized endothelial cell-specific Prox1 overexpression mutants. When induced during embryonic stages of BBB formation, endothelial Prox1 expression induces hybrid blood-lymphatic phenotypes in the developing CNS vasculature. This effect is not observed when Prox1 is overexpressed during postnatal BBB maturation. Ectopic Prox1 expression leads to significant vascular malformations and enhanced vascular leakage, resulting in BBB disruption when induced during both embryonic and postnatal stages. Mechanistically, PROX1 downregulates critical BBB-associated genes, including {beta}-catenin and Claudin-5, which are essential for BBB development and maintenance.

Combined lack of maternal Tdrd6a and Tdrd6c still allows the initial germplasm formation but causes its dispersal during the first hours of development.

To test these techniques, we analyze the transcriptomes of two male reproductive organs, testes and accessory glands, across 11 species of the Drosophila melanogaster species group. We first discretize gene expression states by estimating the probability that each gene is expressed in each organ and species. We then define a phylogenetic model of correlated transcriptome evolution in two or more organs and fit it to the expression state data.

Sakura is predominantly expressed in the ovaries, particularly in the germline cells, including GSCs. sakura null mutant female flies display rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous phenotypes, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. The germline-specific depletion of sakura impairs Dpp/BMP signaling, leading to aberrant bag-of-marbles (bam) expression, resulting in faulty differentiation and loss of GSCs. Additionally, sakura is necessary for normal piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) levels and for proper localization of Oo18 RNA-binding protein (Orb) in developing oocytes. We identified Ovarian Tumor (Otu) as protein binding partner of Sakura, and we found that loss of otu phenocopies loss of sakura in ovaries.

Comparisons show that RNA binding leads to rearrangements of key elements in the RdRp core and to ordering of the flexible C-terminal domains of NiV L required for RNA capping. Taken together, these results reveal the first structural snapshots of an actively replicating nsNSV RdRp and provide insights into the mechanisms of genome replication and transcription by NiV and related viruses.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616572", "title": "Long deletion signatures in repetitive genomic regions track somatic evolution and enable sensitive detection of microsatellite instability", "authors": "Guo, Q.; Househam, J.; Lakatos, E.; Nowinski, S.; Al Bakir, I.; Grant, H.; Balarajah, V.; Hughes, C.

Long deletions, accumulated through stepwise DNA slippage errors, are significantly more prevalent in metastatic MMRd tumours compared to primary tumours. Importantly, we show that long-deletion signatures harbour features that are distinct from background noise, making them robustly detectable even in shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS, [~]0.1X coverage) of formalin-fixed samples.

Classical literature from Weihs and Lighthill suggests that fish schools should favor planar diamond formations to increase hydrodynamic efficiency, inspiring a large body of work ranging from fluid simulations to hydrofoil experiments. However, whether fish schools actually adopt and maintain this idealized formation remains debated and unresolved. When fish schools are free to self-organize in three dimensions, what formations do they prefer? By tracking polarized schools of giant danios (Devario aequipinnatus) swimming continuously for ten hours, we demonstrate that fish rarely stay in a horizontal plane, and even more rarely, in the classical diamond formation. Of all fish pairs within four body-lengths from each other, only 25.2% are in the same plane. Of these, 54.6% are inline, 30.0% are staggered, and 15.4% are side-by-side. The diamond formation was observed in less than 0.1% of all frames. Notably, a \"ladder formation\" emerged as the most probable formation for schooling giant danios, appearing in 79% of all fish pairs and fish schools elongate at higher swimming speeds. These findings highlight the dynamic and three-dimensional nature of fish schools and suggest that hydrodynamic benefits may be obtained without requiring fixed positions.

Currently, an experimental structure of nitazene bound to the molecular target, the {micro}-opioid receptor ({micro}OR), is lacking, hindering the understanding of their structure-activity relationships. Here we employed a suite of computational approaches, encompassing consensus docking, metadynamics, and conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) refinement, to determine the putative {micro}OR binding poses of eight nitazenes, including the nitro-containing meto-, eto-, proto-, buto-, and isotonitazene and the nitro-less metodes-, etodes-, and protodesnitazene. Docking generated three possible binding modes, whereby the nitro-substituted or unsubstituted benzimidazole group extends into subpocket 1 (SP1) between transmembrane helix (TM) 2 and 3, subpocket 2 (SP2) between TM2, TM7, and TM1 or subpocket 3 (SP3) between between TM5 and TM6. Metadynamics and cMD simulations suggested that the SP2-binding mode is most stable for etonitazene and analogs as well as etodesnitazene. Based on the comparison to the experimental structures of BU72-, fentanyl- and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (MP)-bound {micro}OR, we proposed a general model for receptor-opioid recognition, which involves interactions with SP1, SP2 and SP3. The hydrophobic SP1 prefers an aromatic moiety, such as the phenyl ring of BU72 and fentanyl. In contrast, the hydrophilic SP2 and SP3 favor a polar group which can form water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions with the conserved Tyr751.39 and His2976.52. Our findings provide molecular insights into the mechanism of receptor-opioid recognition, paving the way for investigations of the structure-activity relationships of nitazenes.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616560v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1754d70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f2920org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3517dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2536e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616457", "title": "Mechanical constraints organize 3D tissues and orchestrate muscle differentiation", "authors": "Nagle, I.; van der Spek, L.; Gesenhues, P.; Savy, T.; Rea, L.; Richert, A.; Receveur, M.; Delort, F.; Batonnet-Pichon, S.; Wilhelm, C.; Luciani, N.; Reffay, M.", "author_corresponding": "Myriam Reffay", "author_corresponding_institution": "Laboratoire Matiere et Systemes Complexes", "date": "2024-10-04", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/04/2024.10.03.616457.source.xml", "abstract": "Biological tissues achieve proper shape and ordered structures during development through responses to internal and external signals, with mechanical cues playing a crucial role.

Investigating STAT1s function in isogenic colorectal tumor cells with wild-type or mutant KRAS, we found that STAT1 specifically promotes the survival and proliferation of cells with mutant KRAS. Through gene expression profiling, we discovered a previously unknown role of STAT1 in upregulating sterol and lipid biosynthetic genes specifically in mutant KRAS cells. This effect is driven by STAT1s phosphorylation at serine 727 and its cooperation with STAT3 and STAT5 for the transcriptional upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) 1 and 2, which boost de novo sterol and lipid biosynthesis. In mutant KRAS cells, STAT1 amplifies the mevalonate pathway, maintaining its serine 727 phosphorylation through RHO GTPase signaling and establishing a positive feedback loop through the transcription factors YAP1 and TEAD4, further driving lipid biosynthesis and tumor growth. Through xenograft tumor assays in mice, we discovered that the STAT1-YAP1 axis plays a role in mutant KRAS tumor cells resistance to mevalonate pathway inhibitors, which can be overcome by pharmacologically targeting the YAP1-TEAD interaction. Additionally, the STAT1-YAP1 arm is essential for the intrinsic resistance to EGFR-targeting therapy in the mutant KRAS colon cancer cells.

Forecasting epidemics requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving spore dispersal. Many studies have either employed field data for purely correlative approaches without incorporating established knowledge on physical mechanisms or, conversely, relied on specific physical approaches in controlled environments focusing on only a few mechanisms or factors. Little emphasis has been placed on holistic field-based studies, where wind and rain play crucial roles. This study fills that gap by attempting to unravel the processes by which rainfall affects airborne spore concentrations over a wheat canopy during active rust epidemics. Over more than two months, bi-hourly spore counts from Burkard traps were integrated with detailed meteorological data, revealing both seasonal and diurnal trends. Diurnal peaks in airborne spore concentrations, typically driven by cyclic changes in wind and humidity, were dramatically altered by rain. Rain events either amplified spore concentrations by up to 25-fold through  rain-puff and/or depletes them via  wash-out and  wash-off. Rains events from the dataset were classified into categories with distinct impacts:  precursor rains often trigger spore release, while  follower (and prolonged rains) reduce airborne spore concentrations. Moreover, differences in the dispersal dynamics of Pst and Pt were observed, and some were linked to how humidity and wind influence spore clustering. These results provide valuable insights for a more integrated understanding of the effect of rain and in order to enhance forecasting models.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616661", "title": "Systems genetic dissection of Alzheimer's disease brain gene expression networks", "authors": "Zhao, P.; El Fadel, O.; Le, A.; Mangleburg, C.

We have functionally dissected 30 AD-associated gene coexpression modules using a cross-species strategy in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) models.

To confirm causal modules and pinpoint AD network drivers, we performed systematic in vivo genetic manipulations of 357 conserved, prioritized targets, identifying 141 modifiers of A{beta}- and/or tau-induced neurodegeneration. We discover an up-regulated network that is significantly enriched for both AD risk variants and markers of immunity / inflammation, and which promotes A{beta} and tau-mediated neurodegeneration based on fly genetic manipulations in neurons. By contrast, a synaptic regulatory network is strongly downregulated in human brains with AD and is enriched for loss-of-function suppressors of A{beta}/tau in Drosophila.

However, challenges remain in cases where the molecular signals are ambiguous, complicating the assignment of cell fate. During viral infection, programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, exhibit complex signaling and molecular crosstalk.

To address this challenge, we employed deep learning-based image classification of dying cells to analyze PCD in single Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1)-infected cells. Our approach reveals that despite heterogeneous activation of signaling, individual cells adopt predominantly prototypical death morphologies. Nevertheless, PCD is executed heterogeneously within a uniform population of virus-infected cells and varies over time.

Extensive experimental evidence indicates that the gustatory cortex (GC) is engaged in taste perception, palatability and preference. However, our knowledge of the neural and neurochemical signals regulating taste preference is rather limited. Neuromodulators can affect preferences, though their effects on neural circuits for taste are incompletely understood. Neurosteroids are of particular interest in view of reports that systemic administration of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a potent modulator of tonic GABAergic inhibition, induces hyperphagia and increases intake of energy rich food in human and animal subjects. Tonic inhibition is a powerful modulator of circuit excitability and is primarily mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors containing the delta subunit ({delta}-GABAARs). These receptors are widely distributed in the brain, but information regarding the expression of {delta}-GABAARs within gustatory circuits is lacking, and their role in taste preference has not been investigated. Here, we focused on GC to investigate whether activation of {delta}-GABAARs affects sweet taste preference in adult mice. Our data reveal that {delta}-GABAARs are expressed in multiple cell types within GC. These receptors mediate an allopregnanolone-sensitive tonic current and decrease sweet taste preference by altering the behavioral sensitivity to sucrose concentration in a cell type-specific manner.

Here, we validate that LvCMTM4 is a transmembrane protein and show that perturbation of CMTM4 expression via zygotic morpholino or mRNA injection perturbs skeletal patterning, resulting in loss of secondary skeletal elements and rotational defects. We also demonstrate that normal levels of CMTM4 are required for normal PMC migration and filopodial organization, and that these effects are not due to gross mis-specification of the ectoderm. Finally, we show that CMTM4 is sufficient to mediate PMC cell-cell adhesion.

Metagenomic-based analyses have revealed that soil pH selects for distinct populations and community structures for both phage and hosts at local and global scales. However, whether contrasting soil pH represents a selective barrier for phages capable of infecting an individual host is unknown. To examine the influence of pH on individual host-virus interactions, two closely related Bacillus strains were isolated and characterized from pH 7.5 soil associated with a long-term contiguous pH gradient (pH 4.5 to 7.5). Phages infecting each strain were subsequently enriched from soils across the pH gradient (pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5), enumerated using a plaque assay, and characterized via metagenomic analysis. Phages infecting each strain were cultivated from all soils but their community composition and abundance varied with pH. Phage populations infecting each of the two strains were distinct despite the close relatedness of the two hosts, indicating relatively narrow host ranges for each virus.

Fencing off experimental areas (exclosures) has been a common experimental approach to assess how removing large-body size hosts may affect disease risk, especially with tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) such as those causing Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. However, exclosure experiments have found conflicting results based on the scale of the experiment, with smaller exclosures tending to increase tick densities inside the exclosure (suggesting large incompetent mammal hosts produce a dilution effect) and larger exclosures tending to decrease tick densities inside (suggesting an amplification effect). Previously, we have lacked a unifying theoretical framework able to reconcile the results of exclosure experiments on multiple spatial scales. Here we present a spatially explicit model of TBP risk incorporating tick dispersal by small competent mammal hosts (rodents) which can enter the exclosure and by large incompetent mammal hosts (deer) which are excluded from the exclosure. Our model reproduces the scale-dependence observed in past exclosure experiments and neatly illustrates the mechanisms that cause it. Specifically, the modeled exclosure produces high densities of infected questing ticks near its boundary due to a dilution effect with deer, but the density drops off steeply moving into the exclosures center due to the limits of rodent-based tick dispersal. Though this contrasts with empirical results which have found lower tick densities at the exclosures edge than its center, we demonstrate that this contrasting pattern can also be produced if we additionally allow ticks in their free-living questing stage to disperse. We derive analytic expressions for our models resulting infected tick density gradients inside the exclosure, and encourage empiricists to test for such tick density gradients in future exclosure experiments rather than averaging measurements over the entire exclosure.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616481", "title": "Interspecies hybridization as a route of accessory chromosome origin in fungal species infecting wild grasses", "authors": "Fagundes, W.

The most well-characterized electrophysiological signal elicited by a balance disturbance is the perturbation-evoked N1 potential that peaks 100-200 msec post-perturbation and is thought to reflect error processing. We previously found associations between the N1 and individual differences in balance ability, suggesting it may be a potential biomarker of balance health. However, a potential biomarker of balance function will be limited by its reliability and clinical feasibility, which has yet to be established. Here, we characterized the reliability of the N1 elicited by standing balance perturbations within and between sessions over a one-week interval in 10 younger and 14 older adults. A subset of older adults (n=12) completed a session approximately one year prior to the main experiment. We extracted N1 amplitude and latency from the Cz electrode using an advanced, computationally-intensive approach that relies on large amounts of data (e.g., 64 channels, many trials), Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Internal consistency was quantified by split-half reliability using the Spearman correlation coefficient. N1s varied across individuals (amplitude:12-82{micro}V, latency: 142-282ms), yet within individuals, the N1 showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>0.9) across a one-week and one-year time span. N1 amplitude reached excellent internal reliability for each session and group (r>0.9), that generally plateaued within 6 trials, while more trials were needed to reliably measure N1 latency. Similar results were obtained when quantifying N1s using a minimal approach performed with only three electrodes and simple preprocessing. Overall, the N1 is stable within and across sessions, and is largely independent of approach suggesting it could be a clinically-feasible biomarker of balance function. Characterizing reliability in populations with neurologic dysfunction and in different environmental contexts will be necessary to enhance our understanding of the N1, optimize experimental design, and determine its predictive validity of clinical outcomes (e.g., falls risk).", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.03.616574", "title": "SPLASH-structure: a statistical approach to identify RNA secondary structures from raw sequencing data, bypassing multiple sequence alignment", "authors": "Wang, J.

Computational approaches, leveraging evolutionary signals from correlated positions mutations, provide an alternative means to infer RNA structures.

Although restenosis rates are significantly reduced by the development of drug-eluting, the stent may not be implanted at all atherosclerotic sites, and long-term dual anti-platelet therapy is needed after stent implantation. Thus, it is essential to elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying neointimal formation for developing novel therapies. Latexin (LXN), a previously identified pro-inflammatory protein, is highly expressed in vasculature and its expression is regulated by shear stress. Whether it plays a role in vascular remodeling, however, remains unknown.\n\nObjectiveTo determine whether LXN is involved in neointimal formation, and if so, to define the molecular mechanisms involved.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe found that the expression of LXN was significantly increased in neointimal hyperplasia, as determined by western blot. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that increased LXN expression was predominantly localized in smooth muscle cells and macrophages. To determine the cell specific roles of LXN in neointimal formation after injury, we generated global, smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific, endothelial specific-, and myeloid-specific LXN knockout (KO) mice. We found that global, SMC-, and myeloid-specific LXN deficiency markedly prevented neointimal hyperplasia in mice after carotid artery ligation, whereas LXN deficiency in endothelial cells had no effects. Mechanistically, we found that LXN deficiency in SMCs significantly attenuated SMC proliferation and migration, mainly through inhibiting the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. Intriguely, LXN deficiency in macrophages inhibited monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)-induced macrophage migration through inhibiting ERK phosphorylation.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, we for the first time demonstrated that LXN is essentially involved in SMC proliferation and microphage migration.

Because of the development of drug-eluting stents, restenosis rates have been significantly reduced; however, it is still essential to explore the detailed mechanisms underlying neointimal hyperplasia. Latexin (LXN) is considered a novel pro-inflammatory protein that is ubiquitously expressed in vascular and immune cells. We found that LXN is elevated in neointimal hyperplasia, and its deficiency in SMCs and macrophages, but not in ECs, markedly prevents neointimal formation after carotid artery ligation in mice. Mechanistically, LXN deficiency in SMCs prevents SMC proliferation and migration via attenuation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression. Further, myeloid-specific LXN deficiency inhibits monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced macrophage migration via attenuation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose physiological role is related to the modulation of microtubule dynamics and the correct axonal transport in neurons. In tauopathies, the mechanism of conversion of the tau molecule from a physiological to a pathological form is still unclear. Nevertheless, two hexapeptide sequences, named PHF6 and PHF6*, located in the R3 and R2 repetition domains of tau, respectively, seem to be crucial in triggering the aggregation. In the native state, the hydrophobic residues of PHF6 and PHF6* are protected by a {beta}-hairpin-like structure. Contrary to that, the misfolded protein exposes hydrophobic residues, which can form hydrophobic interactions and drive the self-assembly process. Chemical model systems, other than being more straightforward and easily accessible than full-length proteins, can provide valuable insight, which is difficult to tease out by studying the natural systems directly, and can especially be employed to examine the structures and modes of folding of amyloid proteins. Here, we exploit the use of chemical systems to modulate and study the mechanism of tau misfolding and aggregation. By employing a new non-natural {beta}2,2-amino acid, we have induced the two hot spot sequences of tau (PHF6 and PHF6*) either to have a totally extended conformation or a {beta}-hairpin, according to the (S) or (R) stereochemistry of the scaffold, respectively. The aim of this work was to provide, through the interchange between {beta}-hairpin-like and extended conformations, a possible explanation for the mechanism of tau misfolding. We demonstrated that an extended conformation, exposing the hydrophobic residues of both sequences and driving away PHF6* from PHF6, can trigger the aggregation of tau and behaves as a seed-competent monomer model system. Conversely, a {beta}-hairpin imitates the favorable folding of tau, allowing the protein to maintain its soluble monomeric form. Furthermore, a {beta}-hairpin mimic, based on the chaperone protein Hsp90, demonstrated the further application of this type of peptidomimetic foldamers as both aggregation inhibitors and chaperone mimics for the corrective folding of tau in a neuronal environment.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616649", "title": "An active matter model captures the spatial dynamics of actomyosin oscillations during morphogenesis", "authors": "Mackay, E.

Prolonged periods of low oxygen and high organic matter input have been put forward to cause an imbalanced microbial methane cycle, as methane oxidation cannot keep up with methane production. However, it is still unclear what factors affect each process and which microorganisms are responsible. Here we show that methanogenic processes dominate microbial methane cycling in the anoxic sediments of marine Lake Grevelingen (NL) after summer stratification with bottom water anoxia. We observed a shallow and narrow sulfate-methane transition zone between 5 and 15 cm depth, with high methane concentrations (> 5 mM) below this zone. Methanogenesis was dominant over methanotrophy in all investigated layers as active methanogenesis potential was detected down to 60 cm below sea floor, but methane oxidation was only observed in a narrow section of the sulfate-methane transition zone. Based on amplicon sequencing and sediment incubations, we uncovered a metabolically and phylogenetically diverse methanogenic community with distinct niche separation in different sediment layers. ANME archaea and their putative syntrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria were restricted to a narrow zone and were co-occurring with the detected methane oxidation activity. Our results suggest that eutrophication and deoxygenation will further contribute to rising methane emissions in coastal areas, as the microbial methane cycle will be tilted towards increased methanogenesis while the efficiency of the microbial methane filter is expected to decline.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616635", "title": "Melanocyte differentiation and mechanosensation are differentially modulated by distinct extracellular matrix proteins", "authors": "Luthold, C.; Didion, M.; Benedum, E.; Burkhart, A.-K.; Demmerle, N.; Gunaratnam, G.; Racz, V.

Epidermal melanocytes typically interact with the collagen IV-rich basement membrane, but upon injury or in pathological conditions, they can encounter environments rich in collagen I or fibronectin. While alterations in ECM composition and stiffness are known to impact cell behavior, the specific roles of each of these cues for melanocyte functions remain unclear. To explore the impact of these extrinsic cues, we here exposed murine melanocytes to different ECM proteins as well as varying substrate stiffnesses. This study identified MITF, a key regulator of melanocyte differentiation and function, as an ECM- and mechanosensitive transcription factor. We further revealed that distinct ECM proteins and substrate stiffness engage a MEK/ERK/MITF signaling axis to control melanocyte functions. Exposure of melanocytes to collagen I restricted ERK activation, promoting high nuclear MITF levels associated with melanocyte proliferation and differentiation. Conversely, fibronectin elicited elevated ERK activation, leading to low nuclear MITF, correlating with a dedifferentiated and motile phenotype. Importantly, inhibiting ERK activity in melanocytes cultured on fibronectin led to increased MITF nuclear localization, MITF target gene expression and enhanced melanogenesis. Additionally, we uncovered that melanocyte mechanoresponses differ depending on the specific ECM environment.

Hummingbirds, in particular, are ideal subjects to test a method for this estimation due to their fast wing motions and unique aerodynamics, which results from their ecological diversification, adaptation to high-altitude environments, and sexually selected displays. Traditionally, wingbeat frequency measurements have been done via \"manual\" image/sound processing. In this study, we present an automated method to detect, track, classify, and monitor hummingbirds in high-speed video footage, accurately estimating their wingbeat frequency using computer vision techniques and signal analysis. Our approach utilizes a zero-shot learning algorithm that eliminates the need for labeling during training. Results demonstrate that our method can produce automated wingbeat frequency estimations with minimal supervision, closely matching those performed by trained human observers. This comparison indicates that our method can, in some scenarios, achieve low or zero error compared to a human, making it a valuable tool for flight analysis.

Many of these transcriptional subtypes are defined by mutations in transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes, but how such diverse mutations lead to distinct transcriptional subtypes remains unclear. To illuminate the chromatin regulatory landscape in B-ALL, we analyzed 3D genome organization, open chromatin, and gene expression in 53 primary patient samples. At the level of 3D genome organization, we identified chromatin interactions that vary across transcriptional subtypes. These sites of variable 3D chromatin interactions correlate with local gene expression changes and are enriched for core drivers of B-ALL observed in genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens. Sites of variable 3D genome interactions are frequently shared across multiple transcriptional subtypes and are enriched for open chromatin sites found in normal B-cell development but repressed in mature B-cells. Within an individual patient sample, the chromatin landscape can resemble progenitor chromatin states at some loci and mature B-cell chromatin at others, suggesting that the chromatin in B-ALL patient tumor cells is in a partially arrested immature state. By analyzing transcriptomic data from large cohorts of B-ALL patients, we identify gene expression programs that are shared across transcriptional subtypes, associated with B-cell developmental stages, and predictive of patient survival. In combination, these results show that the 3D genome organization of B-ALL reflects B-cell developmental stages and helps illustrate how B-cell developmental arrest interacts with transcriptional subtypes to drive B-ALL.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616646", "title": "Trans-generational adaptation to maternal climate through hormone transport in plants", "authors": "Chen, X.; Bezodis, W.; Gonzalez-Suarez, P.; Knitlhoffer, V.; Goldson, A.; Lister, A.; Macaulay, I.; Penfield, S.", "author_corresponding": "Steven Penfield", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Crop Genetics, John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, NR4 7UH, United Kingdom", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "plant biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.10.04.616646.source.xml", "abstract": "Whether organisms can inherit parental adaptations to the environment is a major question in evolutionary biology.

This study investigates the intricate connections among amino acids, metabolic processes, growth, sleep patterns, amino acid-deficient diets, and caffeine consumption. Emphasizing the crucial links between diet, oxidative stress, and cognitive health, the research underscores the essential role of quality sleep in maintaining cognitive function. The bidirectional relationship between disrupted sleep and cognitive health, as well as the impact of caffeine on cognitive function, is explored. The study involved adult male Wistar rats divided into 10 groups A - J based on cage conditions and diet. Group A-E were kept in a normal cage with diets containing varying levels of tryptophan and other essential amino acids, while Group F-J underwent sleep deprivation using a disk-over-water method and received diets with varying tryptophan and other essential amino acid levels, in addition to caffeine. The experiment spanned 2 weeks, blood samples were collected on days 1,4,7, and 13 for relevant biochemical serum analyses, and the rats were sacrificed on the fourteenth day for blood sample collection, biochemical assays, and brain histology. The 2-week experiment revealed a linear decrease in melatonin and serotonin levels across all caffeine-administered groups, possibly due to stress and anxiety as compared with the reduction in these parameters observed in control rats, suggesting melatonin and serotonin as potential sleep deprivation biomarkers. Testosterone and insulin-like growth hormone assays showed a significant decrease in sleep-deprived rats with caffeine, impacting secondary sex characteristics and growth. Elevated TNF- and interleukin-1b levels in the caffeine-administered, sleep-deprived group suggest potential health risks associated with sleep deprivation and caffeine. Serum assays for antioxidant enzymes indicated heightened oxidative stress in sleep-deprived rats with caffeine. Histopathological studies revealed cellular abnormalities in the sleep-deprived group, indicating increased cellular metabolism and potential pathological conditions. This study elucidates the complex relationships among sleep, dietary factors, and hormonal and inflammatory responses. It underscores the potential neurotoxic effects associated with caffeine consumption when coupled with sleep deprivation. These results underscore the urgent need for further investigation into dietary strategies that could alleviate these adverse effects and promote better health.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616710", "title": "Prevalence and Dynamics of Genome Rearrangements in Bacteria and Archaea", "authors": "Martinez-Gutierrez, C.

Here, we assessed the dynamics and the drivers of genomic rearrangements across 121 microbial species. We show that synteny is highly conserved within most species, although several species present exceptionally flexible genomic layouts. Our results show a rather variable pace at which genomic rearrangements occur across bacteria and archaea, pointing to different selective constraints driving the accumulation of genomic changes across species. Importantly, we found that not only inversions but also translocations are highly enriched near the origin of replication (Ori), which suggests that many rearrangements may confer an adaptive advantage to the cell through the relocation of genes that benefit from gene dosage effects. Finally, our results support the view that mobile genetic elements, in particular transposable elements, are the main drivers of genomic translocations and inversions.

The upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana sleeps, and this behavior is controlled by radially-spaced marginal ganglia. After defining a sleep-wake threshold, we compared gene expression profiles of ganglia from animals sleep-deprived for two nights and found differential expression in many sleep-related genes including GABAergic, melatonergic, and cholinergic receptors. We focused on a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit-like (Chrnal-E), based on its differential expression, and selected animals for a second round of RNAseq that included both light-based and mechanically-based sleep-deprivation. Combining datasets revealed a short list of differentially expressed genes, of which chrnal-E is the most recognizable and well-supported, so we investigated its potential role in sleep regulation. First, we found that chemical cholinergic neuromodulators positively regulate pacemaker activity. Then, we showed by in situ hybridization that chrnal-E is expressed primarily within the ganglia, and that the area of expression expands after sleep deprivation. Next, we developed RNAi for use in Cassiopea and determined that Chrnal-E promotes wakefulness. Finally, we sampled circadian timepoints in the field and found in control conditions, chrnal-E has lowest expression late at night, but in sleep deprived animals, chrnal-E peaks at this time, supporting a link to wakefulness.

Fecal bile acids activate neurons in the AOS, potentially serving as mammalian pheromones and kairomones, but few molecules in this large class have been evaluated thus far. We used live volumetric Ca2+ imaging to screen naturally occurring bile acids for their capacity to activate peripheral vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). We found that taurine-conjugated bile acids (tauro-BAs), including taurine-conjugates of cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid (TCA, TDCA, TLCA, TCDCA, respectively) activate large populations of VSNs at sub-micromolar concentrations. Tauro-BA-sensitive VSNs rarely responded to unconjugated (CA, CDCA, DCA, LCA), glycine-conjugated (GCA, GDCA, GLCA, GCDCA), or keto-conjugated (7-keto DCA, 12-keto DCA, 7-keto LCA) bile acids. Tauro-BA-sensitive VSNs were also insensitive to well-studied sulfated steroids, suggesting tauro-BAs activate vomeronasal receptors that have not yet been de-orphaned. Among the tauro-BAs, TDCA displayed particularly strong potency, activating many VSNs at sub-micromolar concentrations. Tauro-BAs were not detectable in mouse fecal extracts by mass spectrometry, but were found in reptile fecal extracts and germ-free mouse fecal extracts. VSN responses to germ-free and conventional mouse fecal extracts, conjugated bile acids, and tauro-BAs revealed that non-overlapping populations of VSNs respond to germ-free and conventional mouse feces. A subset of VSNs that were activated by germ-free mouse fecal extracts responded to tauro-BAs, whereas VSNs responsive to conventionally fecal extracts responded to unconjugated bile acids. In vivo exposure to TDCA alone, and to mouse fecal extracts spiked with TDCA, elicited mild aversion and stress-associated behaviors in a non-social context (avoidance, digging, grooming, etc.).

Despite weak summation of this synaptic input, optogenetic activation of these axons in LC enhances tonic firing and facilitates real-time and conditioned aversive behavior. We hypothesized this VTA-LC glutamatergic projection may provide modulatory synaptic integration with other excitatory inputs. To test this notion, we used coincident photostimulation of VTA-LC axons and local electrical stimulation and demonstrate enhanced burst induction in the LC. To determine whether this integration also occurs in vivo, we took an analogous approach using the Punishment Risk Task to measure the reward-seeking behavior during unpredictable probabilistic punishment. Here, optogenetic activation of the VTA-LC glutamatergic projections with a concurrent noxious stimulus did not delay the reward-seeking behavior, but increased the probability of task failure.

However, optimal subcortical targets for therapeutic stimulation are not well established. Here, we leveraged 7 Tesla resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 168 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project to map the subcortical connectivity of six canonical cortical networks that modulate higher-order cognition and function: the default mode, executive control, salience, dorsal attention, visual, and somatomotor networks. Based on spatiotemporally overlapped networks generated by the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition method, our goal was to identify subcortical hubs that are functionally connected to multiple cortical networks. We found that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain and the central lateral (CL) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei of the thalamus - regions that have historically been targeted by neuromodulatory therapies to restore consciousness - are subcortical hubs widely connected to multiple cortical networks. Further, we identified a subcortical hub in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum that overlapped with multiple reticular and extrareticular arousal nuclei and that encompassed a well-established \"hot spot\" for coma-causing brainstem lesions. Multiple hubs within the brainstem arousal nuclei and thalamic intralaminar nuclei were functionally connected to both the DMN and SN, emphasizing the importance of these cortical networks in integrative subcortico-cortical signaling. Additional subcortical connectivity hubs were observed within the caudate head, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, regions classically associated with modulation of cognition, behavior, and sensorimotor function. Collectively, these results suggest that multiple subcortical hubs in the brainstem tegmentum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe modulate cortical function in the human brain. Our findings strengthen the evidence for targeting subcortical hubs in the ventral tegmental area, central lateral thalamus, and pontomesencephalic tegmentum to restore consciousness in patients with DoC.

In the follicular epithelium of Drosophila ovaries, tricellular junctions (TCJs) open transiently in a process termed patency to allow passage of externally produced yolk proteins for uptake by the oocyte. Here we show that modulation of actomyosin contractility at cell vertices controls TCJ permeability. Before patency, circumferential actomyosin bundles are anchored at apical follicle cell vertices, where tension-sensing junctional proteins, Rho-associated kinase (Rok), and active Myosin II accumulate and maintain vertices closed. TCJ opening is initiated by redistribution of Myosin II from circumferential bundles to a medial pool, accompanied by decreasing tension on vertices. This transition requires activation of Cofilin-dependent F-actin disassembly by the phosphatase Slingshot and Myosin II inactivation by Myosin light chain phosphatase, and is counteracted by Rok. Accordingly, constitutive activation of Myosin or of Rho signaling prevent vertex opening, whereas reduced Myosin II or Rok activity cause excessive and premature vertex opening. Thus, opening of intercellular gaps in the follicular epithelium does not require actomyosin-based forces, but relies on a reduction of actomyosin contractility. Conversely, F-actin assembly is required for closing intercellular gaps after patency. Our findings are consistent with a force transduction model in which TCJ integrity is maintained by vertex-anchored contractile actomyosin. We propose that the cell-type-specific organization of actomyosin at cell vertices determines the mode of contractility-dependent regulation of epithelial permeability.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616762", "title": "Heterogeneous distribution of inhibitory inputs among motor units as a key mechanism for motor adaptations to pain", "authors": "Hug, F.; Dernoncourt, F.; Avrillon, S.; Thorstensen, J.; Besomi, M.; van den Hoorn, W.; Tucker, K.", "author_corresponding": "Francois Hug", "author_corresponding_institution": "Universite Cote d\\\\\\'Azur", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.10.05.616762.source.xml", "abstract": "Pain significantly influences movement, yet the precise neural mechanisms underlying the wide range of observed motor adaptations remain unclear.

Seventeen participants performed isometric knee extension tasks under three conditions: Control, Pain (induced by injecting hypertonic saline into the infra-patellar fat pad), and Washout. We identified large samples of motor units in the vastus lateralis (up to 53/participant) from high-density electromyographic signals, which led to three key observations. First, while motor unit discharge rates significantly decreased during Pain, a substantial proportion of motor units (14.8-24.8%) did not show this decrease and, in some cases, even exhibited an increase. Second, using complementary approaches we showed that pain did not alter the amplification and prolongation effects of persistent inward currents on motor unit discharge, providing evidence that neuromodulatory drive to motor neurons remained unchanged. Third, we observed a significant reduction in the proportion of common inputs to motor units during Pain. To explore potential neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these experimental results, we simulated the behaviour of motor unit pools with varying distribution patterns of inhibitory inputs.

We used the system to track weight fluctuations in six canaries over several weeks, revealing physiological patterns such as overnight weight loss, with one bird losing approximately 5.17% of its body weight during a 9.5-hour period of inactivity.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Their potential extends beyond simple language tasks, offering transformative possibilities in scientific research of all fields. By leveraging vast amounts of data and advanced computational power, LLMs can assist researchers in generating novel ideas, automating routine tasks, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. On September 12, 2024, OpenAI released their updated generative artificial intelligence system called ChatGPTo1. This new AI system, built upon chain-of-thought and reinforcement learning, has greatly enhanced logical reasoning abilities and can effectively solve various complex problems from elementary-level mathematical problems to modern scientific research issues in physics, chemistry, and biology. Unlike previous LLMs in which logical reasoning and data analysis abilities are developed through training on actual data, ChatGPTo1 logical reasoning ability and capacity to generate new scientific ideas are primarily acquired through chain-of-thought processes and reinforcement learning rather than pre-training. To examine this, we specifically tested ChatGPTo1 current reasoning and scientific discovery capabilities by developing theoretically complex and quantitatively challenging scientific equations in various fields of neuroscience, such as dynamical systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, dynamical systems on differential manifolds, neural field theory, nonlinear divergence theorems, nonlinear heat conduction equations and Laplace equations and their extensions on differential manifolds, nonlinear statistical analysis methods, deep learning, and other topics involving multiple fields. The current large language models may illustrate a certain degree of general intelligence, even if fundamentally it may be different from human intelligence. However, it does not mean the current LLMs can fully apply such ability in practical applications or that their reasoning potential can be fully tapped. It is essential to explore specific pathways and methods to cultivate their potential for scientific discovery. To accomplish this, we consider how to integrate them with common search engines (such as Google) capabilities and ChatGPT4o cross-modal abilities to better understand new disciplines and scientific discoveries. To this point, the major shortcoming of ChatGPTo1 is that it is not an end-to-end scientific discovery method and lacks the ability to achieve full automation. It also lacks methods for image analysis and full-scale data analysis, making it difficult to use simulation and data analysis to evaluate and test proposed new theories and methods.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616737", "title": "A preprocessing toolbox for 2-photon subcellular calcium imaging", "authors": "Jiang, A.; Zhao, C.; Sheffield, M.", "author_corresponding": "Mark Sheffield", "author_corresponding_institution": "University of Chicago", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.10.04.616737.source.xml", "abstract": "Recording the spiking activity from subcellular compartments of neurons such as axons and dendrites during behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging is increasingly common yet remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise, inaccurate region-of-interest (ROI) identification, movement artifacts, and difficulty in grouping ROIs from the same neuron. To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient pre-processing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply band-pass filtering methods (e.g. 0.05 to 0.12 Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from z-plane movement, we apply Principal Component Analysis on all calcium traces and use a Bottom-Up Segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or k-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to \"ground truth\" data.

Evidence suggests that activating neurons expressing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the TRN may enhance sleep quality and potentially ameliorate neuropathology associated with AD.

It is well established that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are key for creating and maintaining associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict, through Pavlovian learning. However, it remains unclear how relevant sensory information is integrated into dopamine (DA) pathways to guide exploration and learning. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is anatomically positioned as a relay for rapid sensory augmentation of dopamine neurons, which could underlie the formation of Pavlovian associations. Here, we characterize the anatomical organization and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA and SNc in rats. First, using anatomical tracing techniques, we show that neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing directly with neurons projecting to the striatum and ventral pallidum. Using fiber photometry, we find that these SC projections excite both dopamine and GABA neurons in the VTA and dopamine neurons in the SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC terminal stimulation did not reliably evoke behavior on their own in an optogenetic Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. Further, optogenetic activation of SC terminals in the VTA/SNc did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference or avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC terminals in the VTA and SNc reliably evoked head turning behavior. This body reorientation increased in intensity with repeated stimulations, suggesting that strengthening this circuit could underlie sensorimotor learning related to exploration and attentional bias.

The precise site of translation initiation of these proteins within the C9ORF72 repeat expansion remains elusive. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to investigate the contribution of different AUG codons in the antisense repeat RNA to the production of DPR proteins, poly(GP) and poly(PR) in C9ORF72 expansion carrier motor neurons and lymphoblast cells. We then utilized ASOs targeting C9ORF72 sense repeat RNA to examine whether sense or antisense RNA is the major source of the poly(GP) protein - a question for which conflicting evidence exists. We found that these ASOs reduced the intended sense RNA target, but also the antisense RNA, thus preventing the production of poly(PR).

Chronoamperometry was used to assess electrochemical activity, which showed fluctuations in electrical current at specific time points in biofilm-forming cells.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed significant differences between the voltammograms of biofilm-forming and biofilm-deficient cells that were hypothesized to be a result of the reduction of secreted flavodoxin only in biofilm-forming cells.

We identified the presence of a charge transfer resistance (Rct) exclusively in biofilm-forming cells which correlated to the time of increased electrochemical activity measured using choronoamperometry. Finally, through confocal microscopy, we found that the expression of a gene involved in biofilm matrix formation, tasA, was correlated with the time where electrochemical charge transfer was measured. Altogether, these results indicate that electrochemical activity is primarily present in biofilm-forming cells rather than in biofilm-deficient mutants.

Therefore, their compatibility with clinical settings is key. Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) is a two-compartment model of GM microstructure that accounts for inter-compartment exchange, whose parameter estimation requires multi-shell multi-diffusion time data. In this work, we report the first estimates of NEXI in human cortex obtained on a clinical MRI scanner. To do that, we establish an acquisition protocol and fitting routine compatible with clinical scanners. The model signal equation can be expressed either in the narrow-pulse approximation, NEXINPA, or accounting for the actual width of the diffusion gradient pulses, NEXIWP. While NEXINPA enables a faster analytical fit and is a valid approximation for data acquired on high-performance gradient systems (preclinical and Connectom scanners), on which NEXI was first implemented, NEXIWP has significant relevance for data acquired on clinical scanners with longer gradient pulses. We establish that, in the context of broad pulses, NEXIWP estimates were more comparable to previous literature values. Furthermore, we evaluate the repeatability of NEXI estimates in the human cortex on a clinical MRI scanner and show intra-subject variability to be lower than inter-subject variability, which is promising for characterizing healthy and patient cohorts. Finally, we analyze the relationship of NEXI parameters on the cortical surface to the Myelin Water Fraction (MWF), estimated using an established multicomponent T2 relaxation technique. Indeed, although it is present in small quantities in the cortex, myelin can be expected to decrease permeability.

In this study, we used a large database of fMRI data (n =323 humans of both sexes included) from across the adult lifespan (ages 18-88) to determine the degree of functional differentiation across the hippocampal posterior-anterior axis. Our first approach was to measure the similarity among signals within each hippocampal subregion. We found that intra-region signals within the most posterior hippocampal subregion became more similar in older age, but did not relate to episodic memory performance. As a second approach, we measured functional connectivity between hippocampal subregions and the rest of the brain. The functional connectivity profiles of the posterior and anterior hippocampal subregions became more distinct from one another with increasing age, and age-related reductions in connectivity were strongest for the intermediate portion of the hippocampus. In contrast, anterior hippocampal functional connectivity remained relatively stable across the adult lifespan, and stronger anterior hippocampus connectivity with the anterior cingulate was associated with better episodic memory in older adults, suggesting that the anterior hippocampus may help some older adults compensate for age-related changes to more posterior hippocampal regions to preserve episodic memory.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616694", "title": "Tag with Caution - How protein tagging influences the formation of condensates", "authors": "D/\"orner, K.; Gut, M.; Overwijn, D.; Cao, F.; Siketanc, M.; Heinrich, S.; Beuret, N.; Sharpe, T.; Lindorff-Larsen, K.; Hondele, M.", "author_corresponding": "Maria Hondele", "author_corresponding_institution": "Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland", "date": "2024-10-05", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "molecular biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/05/2024.10.04.616694.source.xml", "abstract": "Fluorescent proteins and peptide tags are essential tools in cellular biology, but can alter the biochemical properties of target proteins.

E. histolytica trophozoites (amoebae) can invade the intestine and disseminate via the bloodstream, resisting complement lysis through unknown mechanisms. Amoebae kill human cells by performing trogocytosis. After performing trogocytosis, amoebae display human proteins on their own surface and are resistant to lysis by human serum. In this study we sought to further evaluate the mechanism by which amoebae resist complement. To test if complement is responsible for lysis of amoebae, C3-depleted serum was compared to replete serum, and C3 was required for lysis. Amoebae were allowed to perform trogocytosis of human cells and exposed to mouse serum. Although they had performed trogocytosis on a different species than the source of the serum, they were protected from lysis. To test if the protection from lysis by mouse serum was due to the functional interchangeability of human and mouse complement pathway proteins, human CD46 or CD55 (negative regulators of complement activation) were exogenously expressed. Amoebae that expressed human CD46 or CD55 were protected from lysis by mouse serum, indicating that display of human proteins was sufficient to inhibit mouse complement activation. Finally, amoebae were allowed to perform trogocytosis of a cell type in which the complement pathway is not conserved, and they did not become resistant to lysis. Overall, these findings are consistent with the model that trogocytosis enables amoebic acquisition and display of host proteins, including negative regulators of the complement pathway, that provide protection from complement lysis.

Experimental evolution in combination with re-sequencing has often been used to identify candidate loci for lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. Previous experiments showed that Drosophila populations experimentally evolved to increase late-life reproduction showed a correlated responses in development time, body size, but also lifespan. Subsequent whole genome sequencing allowed for the identification of candidate loci that correlated to lifespan differentiation. However, it remains difficult to assess whether candidate loci affect lifespan and to what extent such loci pleiotropically underpin multiple traits. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that lifespan effects of loci are often context dependent, but genotype-by-genotype interactions remain understudied. Therefore, here, we report on a study where we genotyped 3210 individuals for 32 candidate loci that emerged from our evolve and re-sequence experiment and tested, (1) whether these loci significantly affected lifespan, (2) the effect size of each locus, and, (3) how these loci mutually interact, i.e. determine the level of epistasis in moulding lifespan. Of the 32 loci, six showed significant main effect associations, of which three loci showed effects of 6.6 days difference in lifespan or larger, while the overall average lifespan was 41.7 days. Eight additional significant pairwise interactions between loci were found, of which four (single) main effects and one three-way interaction was significant. Lastly, we found that alleles that increased lifespan did not necessarily have higher frequencies in populations that showed increased lifespan, indicating that lifespan itself had not been the major target of selection.

In recent years, genome-wide studies have used catalogs ranging in size from fewer than 200,000 to over 7 million loci. Where these catalogs overlapped, they often disagreed on locus boundaries, hindering the comparison and reuse of results across studies. Now, with multiple groups developing public databases of TR variation in large population cohorts, there is a risk that, without sufficient consensus in the choice of locus definitions, the use of divergent repeat catalogs will lead to confusion, fragmentation, and incompatibility across future resources.\n\nIn this paper, we compare existing TR catalogs and discuss desirable features of a comprehensive genome-wide catalog. We then present a new, richly annotated catalog designed for large-scale analyses and population databases. Our catalog stratifies TRs into two groups: 1) isolated TRs suitable for repeat copy number analysis using short read or long read data and 2) so-called variation clusters that contain TRs within wider polymorphic regions that are best studied through sequence-level analysis. To define variation clusters, we present a novel algorithm that leverages long-read HiFi sequencing data to group repeats with surrounding polymorphisms. We show that the human genome contains at least 25,000 complex variation clusters, most of which span over 120 bp and contain five or more TRs. Resolving the sequence of entire variation clusters instead of individually genotyping constituent TRs leads to a more accurate analysis of these regions and enables us to profile variation that would have been missed otherwise.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616561", "title": "Intrinsic molecular identifiers enable robust molecular counting in single-cell sequencing", "authors": "Fontanez, K.; Agam, Y.; Bevans, S.; May-Zhang, A.; Hayford, C.; Xue, Y.; Ishibashi, J.

Rocaglates, a class of natural products typified by rocaglamide A (RocA), possess anti-neoplastic and anti-infectious activity mediated by their interaction with eIF4A1. Rocaglates inhibit cap-dependent translation initiation by \"clamping\" eIF4A1 onto polypurine RNA, impeding ribosome scanning. A novel class of rocaglate derivatives, amidino-rocaglates (ADRs) which feature an amidine ring fused to the rocaglate core, are particularly effective at promoting eIF4A1-RNA-clamping compared to other rocaglate congeners.

The binding pose and interactions of the ADR with eIF4A1 do not differ substantially from those of RocA, prompting investigation of the basis for enhanced target engagement. Computational modeling suggests that the rigidified ADR scaffold is inherently preorganized in an eIF4A1-RNA-binding-competent conformation, thereby avoiding entropic penalties associated with RocA binding.

Here, we present a simple and robust maximum entropy reweighting procedure to refine atomic resolution conformational ensembles of IDPs with large experimental datasets consisting of several different types of data. We apply this approach to refine structural ensembles obtained from long timescale MD simulations and generate IDP ensembles with substantially improved agreement with a variety of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. We ask if reweighted IDP ensembles derived from MD simulations run with different force fields converge to similar conformational distributions when extensive experimental datasets are used for refinement. We find that in favorable cases IDP ensembles derived from different force fields become highly similar after reweighting with experimental data.

Furthermore, lungs would increase transcripts associated with nerve activation, and these would be centered in neural and neuroendocrine-like cells. Bulk RNA-seq revealed that genes related to allergen sensing were increased in asthmatic ganglia nodose/jugular ganglia compared to control ganglia. These genes were associated with nodose clusters as shown by single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and a distinct caudal-to-rostral spatial arrangement was presented as delineated by spatial transcriptomics. The distinct clusters closely match previous identification of nodose neuron clusters. Correspondingly, the lung transcriptome was altered with asthmatic induction such that transcripts associated with neural excitation were upregulated.

An important but understudied potential driver of balancing selection is antagonistic pleiotropy between diploid and haploid stages of the plant life cycle.

Theoretical work suggests the antagonistic pleiotropy between life stages can generate balancing selection and maintain genetic variation. Despite the potential for far-reaching consequences of gametophytic selection, empirical tests of its pleiotropic effects (neutral, synergistic, or antagonistic) on sporophytes are generally lacking. Here, we examined the population genomic signals of selection across life stages in the angiosperm Rumex hastatulus and the moss Ceratodon purpureus. We compared gene expression among life stages and between sexes, combined with neutral diversity statistics and the analysis of the distribution of fitness effects. In contrast to what would be predicted under balancing selection due to antagonistic pleiotropy, we found that unbiased genes between life stages are under stronger purifying selection, likely explained by a predominance of synergistic pleiotropy between life stages and strong purifying selection on broadly expressed genes.

To evaluate whether specific types of adaptations evolve at fluctuating temperatures and how population size affects the evolution of trade-offs, we performed an evolution experiment with fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). The small and large populations evolved for 500 generations at constant and fluctuating temperatures, after which the evolved strains competed against ancestral strains in respective selection environments and in alternative environments to detect trade-offs. We observed significant adaptation and maladaptation only to constant heat, but not to fluctuating temperatures.

Such adverse effects on immunity might increase with ageing, worsening disease conditions later in life. Furthermore, malnutrition may persist across generations, imposing strong natural selection to survive the nutrient shortage. However, it is unclear how the evolutionary history of ancestral generations with chronic malnutrition could influence pathogen resistance and infection susceptibility, as well as their age-specific changes in extant generations. To address this, we used Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted against chronic juvenile malnutrition and exposed them to a bacterial pathogen, Providencia rettgeri, during their early and late adulthood. Surprisingly, we observed that in populations adapted to chronic malnutrition, young flies survived infection better by tolerating the infection, while control flies displayed higher infection susceptibility despite carrying a similar pathogen load. However, this pattern in post-infection survival is reversed with ageing. There was no change in pathogen resistance, but evolved flies succumbed more to infection than control flies regardless of the input infection doses.

The SEAC is composed of two subcomplexes, SEACIT, an inhibitor of TORC1 that contains the GAP activity, and SEACAT, that has been proposed to regulate the activity of SEACIT. However, molecular details of its regulation are unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SEAC-EGOC supercomplex and studied its function in TORC1 amino acid signalling. A single SEAC can interact with two EGOC molecules via SEACIT, binding exclusively to the \"active\" version of the EGOC as their interaction depends on Gtr1 being loaded with GTP. SEACAT does not modulate nor interact with the EGOC. The GAP activity of the SEAC is essential for the regulation of TORC1 by amino acids, and its loss phenocopies the lack of Gtr1-Gtr2, establishing the SEAC-EGOC complex as an amino acid-sensing hub. Despite being located far from the active site, deletion of Sea2, or its N-terminal {beta}-propeller domain, also results in defects in amino acid signalling to TORC1. We propose that the SEAC-EGOC supercomplex integrates coatomer-like mechanisms of regulation via bidirectional feedback between GAP-GTPase (SEACIT-EGOC) and coat (SEACAT) modules that explain the functional interaction between Sea2 and the GAP activity.

Gum Arabic (GA) is a tree exudate consisting of 90% arabinogalactan, a polymer of arabinose and galactose sugars with prebiotic properties. As a dietary fibre, GA improves renal function, metabolism, and immune response in humans and animals. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to these health benefits are poorly understood. We supplemented female and male zebrafish (Danio rerio) with two concentrations of GA (6% and 60%) for two weeks. We assessed the effects of GA supplementation on the gut microbiome composition, intestinal and brain metabolic profiles, reproductive fitness, and brain gene expression. We found that GA supplementation resulted in changes to the gut microbiome with a relative increase in Fusobacteria and a relative decrease in Proteobacteria where the beneficial genus Cetobacterium was significantly more abundant after supplementation. GA supplementation increased acetate levels, particularly in the brain, causing a decreased expression of cart1 in the brain of female zebrafish. While GA supplementation increased overall activity in male and female fish, reproductive fitness was negatively affected by GA supplementation in females. Our results suggest that while GA supplementation may have positive effects on metabolic rate and overall activity, it may come at a trade-off with reproductive fitness.\n\nSignificance StatementDietary fibres, found in plant-based food sources, can improve health. They include natural gums like gum Arabic, a highly sought-after food additive used as a homogeniser. Despite our better understanding of nutrition, a fibre gap is still prevalent in the Western world with efforts being made to incorporate new sources to close this gap and boost well-being. Here, we showed that when gum Arabic was supplemented into the zebrafish diet, it had a beneficial modulatory effect on the microbiota-gut-brain axis and reproductive fitness. Our findings support the benefits of dietary fibres but also link their impact to sexual dimorphism and dosage.

Here, we show that a temperature increase to 39-40{degrees}C triggers fluid-phase uptake in PC12 cells and primary neurons. Uptake of selective cargoes shows that clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis are induced in a translation-dependent manner, consistent with a role for heat shock response. Exocytic recycling is also increased by hyperthermia, suggesting a comprehensive boost of membrane trafficking. Mild (<39{degrees}C) whole-body hyperthermia in vivo boosts fluid-phase uptake in various organs, notably enabling brain accumulation of an intravenously injected antibody that is blocked by dynamin inhibition.

L6CT neurons have been reported to induce multiple effects, including the up- and down-modulation of cortical and thalamic firing rates, and the enhancement of high gamma oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) of the surrounding cortex. These recently reported oscillations offer a neuronal substrate to link recurrent thalamocortical interactions, a critical connection hinging on L6CT neurons, to high frequency oscillations, that have been implicated in several cognitive and pathological conditions. We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations induced by L6CT neurons in the cortex depend on the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice selectively expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway of awake, head-fixed mice, we presented LED ramp-and-hold inputs of different intensities while recording neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1), the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm), and the reticular nucleus (TRN) of thalamus using silicon probes. First, we confirmed that the activation of L6CT neurons induces high-frequency oscillation of S1 local field potential. These oscillations are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across LED intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the evolution over time of the firing rate of cortical neurons across layers and electrophysiologic cell classes, VPm, and TRN. While the firing rate of most cortical and TRN neurons was steadily suppressed over time, the firing rate of VPm and Layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to being facilitated within 500 ms. Using dimensionality reduction, we found that this pattern reflects two underlying components: one stable component that is represented across all units, and one evolving component that is mainly represented in VPm and in L4 FS neurons, suggestive of differential recruitment of the cortico-cortical vs cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we related the firing rate of each unit to the amplitude and frequency of S1 LFP, finding that the evolution of S1 LFP amplitude weakly correlates with all neurons, while its frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons generate high gamma oscillations in S1 LFP through a combination of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways and can sculpt its oscillation frequency through the cortico-thalamo-cortical pathway. Our findings provide a neuronal substrate for linking recurrent interactions, mediated by L6CT neurons, to the modulations of high gamma oscillations observed in several brain states and pathological conditions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616828", "title": "A shared code for perceiving and imagining objects in human ventral temporal cortex", "authors": "Wadia, V.

No predictors significantly influenced whether cats found the toy, or which box was checked first (toy or empty box). In IVD trials, we unexpectedly found that cats were more likely to play with and had longer gaze durations towards the toy and display more toy box-directed behaviours in consistent trials than violation trials.

Growing evidence suggests that fMRI brain activity shows spatio-temporal patterns of propagation following specific gradients. In particular, activity around global peaks propagates as a travelling wave following a gradient from unimodal to associative areas. Some properties of these travelling waves seem to be related to behavioral and arousal states, however their meaning remains unknown. Here we assess the possibility that travelling waves explain the finding that there are specific time points when the brain presents larger brain integration. We reasoned that a faster speed of propagation would be related to more brain integration as measured with fMRI. Furthermore, we explored whether increased pupil-linked arousal, which has been related to more integration in specific brain regions, would be increased during periods of whole brain propagation. To test these hypotheses, we detected brain travelling waves and characterized them in terms of speed, directionality and ratio. We compared these features between different task conditions, and after a pharmacological challenge affecting neuromodulatory tone. We then studied the relation between travelling wave speed, pupil size and a graph-based measure of brain integration. Our results suggest that neuromodulatory tone affects travelling wave propagation, and that this propagation reflects changes in arousal and integrated functional connectivity features.

Here, we examined the timeline of plastic changes in M1 of monkeys during learning of sequential movements. A challenge in studying a role of M1 in learning is that its inactivation impairs movement, masking learning processes. To address this, we used a protein synthesis inhibitor to disrupt memory consolidation in M1 during learning.

Accurately quantifying the complete behavioral repertoire can uncover the underlying rules that guide such goal-directed behavior. However, these movements are usually complex, high-dimensional, and lead to various outcomes, posing a challenge to fully capture the complete repertoire. By tracking freely hunting zebrafish larvae using a highspeed camera and analyzing their movements, we developed a mathematical model that accurately reproduces the complete repertoire. Using the model, we show that fish position and change in heading angle following a movement are coupled, such that the choice of one of them limits the possibilities of the other. This repertoire structure uncovered fundamental principles of movements, showing that fish rotate around an identified rotation point and then move forward or backward along straight lines. From the uncovered movement principles, we identified a new guiding rule for prey interaction: in each movement, fish turn to face the prey and then move forward or backward. This enables decoupling between orientation and distance selections of the fish during the hunt. These results provide a comprehensive and continuous description of the repertoire of movements, reveal underlying algorithmic rules that govern the behavior, and offer insights into the potential neural implementation of the repertoire.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616644", "title": "Genetically encoded biosensor for fluorescence lifetime imaging of PTEN dynamics in the intact brain", "authors": "Kagan, T.; Gabay, M.; Levi, Y.; Eid, S.; Malchenko, N.; Maman, M.; Nitzan, A.; Ravotto, L.; Zaidel-Bar, R.; Gal, M.; Laviv, T.", "author_corresponding": "Tal Laviv", "author_corresponding_institution": "Tel Aviv University", "date": "2024-10-06", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/06/2024.10.04.616644.source.xml", "abstract": "The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a vital signaling protein which maintains an inhibitory brake that is critical for cellular metabolism, proliferation, and growth. The importance of PTEN signaling is evident from the broad spectrum of human pathologies associated with its loss of function. Moreover, loss or gain of PTEN function in animal models leads to aberrant cellular morphology, function, and metabolic regulation. However, despite the important role of PTEN signaling, there is currently no method to dynamically monitor its activity with cellular specificity within intact biological systems. Here, we describe the development of a novel PTEN biosensor, optimized for two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM). This biosensor is designed to measure PTEN activity within intact cells, tissues, and organisms. Our approach is based on monitoring FRET-dependent changes in PTEN conformation, which serves as a proxy for the activity state in living cells. We identify a point mutation that allow us to express this biosensor with minimal interference to endogenous PTEN signaling and cellular function. We demonstrate the utility of imaging PTEN signaling in cell lines, developing C. elegans, and in the living mouse brain. To complement this approach, we developed a red-shifted PTEN sensor variant that permits simultaneous imaging with GFP-based sensors. Finally, we use in vivo PTEN imaging in the mouse brain to identify cell-type specific dynamics of PTEN activity in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cells. In summary, our approach enables dynamic imaging of PTEN activity in vivo with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616803", "title": "Neural dynamics for working memory and evidence integration during olfactory navigation in Drosophila", "authors": "Kathman, N.

In this study, we used a recently developed activity monitor to record swimming activity of individual, wild-caught krill under various light conditions and across different seasons.

Lack of appropriate methodologies for conducting cumulative impact assessment is a major concern in Sami indigenous communities across Sapmi, the traditional Sami territory covering the northern parts of Finland, Sweden, Norway and parts of north-western Russia. We report from a project in which a new type of GIS based impact assessment methodology was developed to assess effects of forestry on winter pastures of the Mudusjavri reindeer herding co-operative in northern Finland. Winter pasture quality was studied as a function of cumulative impacts from forestry. The aim was to develop a way to measure the level of harm caused by forestry on Sami culture and rights that are protected by national laws and international conventions - in order to assess whether the threshold for significant and hence unacceptable impact has been exceeded. An existing static model for lichen - the main natural winter fodder for reindeer - both for its biomass and growth was used along with mapped forest data to simulate the impacts of forestry on reindeer herding. Our assessment shows that the intensive industrial loggings that started in the 1950s have reduced the ground lichen biomass in Mudusjavris pastures by over 30% by 2020. The yearly lichen production has been reduced by 23 - 31% and the yearly lichen depending on the model version used. The respective cost of forestry for Mudusjavri reindeer herding is approximately 370 - 530 000 {euro}/year which is approximately half of the total turnover of the co-operative.

For example, specific visual stimuli that indicate prey and that naturally draw appetitive orienting in the adult may be interpreted differently or evoke distinct behaviors during development. What are the neural mechanisms that might allow an animal to flexibly couple the same stimulus information to distinct behavioral outcomes as a function of developmental needs? To begin to address this important question, we quantified visually evoked orienting behaviors between adolescent and adult C57BL6/J mice of both sexes under the natural prey capture context compared to responses in our established virtual motion stimulus paradigm, C-SPOT. Most surprisingly, we discovered that female versus male adolescent mice have opposing innate behavioral biases evoked by the same sweeping motion stimuli which is not present in adulthood. Further, female mice display a robust enhancement of approach towards visual motion over all other groups tested, yet, they are the least aggressive in response to live prey. Thus, our work overall revealed that innate approach towards visual motion is robustly dissociated from predatory aggression in female versus male mice specifically during adolescence. This underscores the different natural behavioral goals and physiological states that uniquely apply to female versus male adolescent animals, and, reveals that approach towards visual motion is a key sensory-motor process selectively augmented during female adolescence.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.01.616202", "title": "Reliability and Validity of the Jumpster accelerometer-based app compared to the Vertec when completing a countermovement jump", "authors": "Holman, M.

In juvenile mice, AC, while all the layers express the BMPR1A receptor, only a thin layer of cells in the deep zone of AC express BMP ligands, and chondrocyte hypertrophy ensues first in this layer. With age, the BMP ligand expression domain expands throughout the AC, leading to BMP signaling activation and resultant chondrocyte hypertrophy. Further, exposure to healthy AC with BMP ligands was sufficient to induce premature OA-like changes in the young adult mice, suggesting BMP signaling is the limiting factor behind age-induced OA. We found that activation of BMP signaling upregulates ICAT expression, a known inhibitor of the canonical Wnt pathway in the AC. Our results suggest that with aging, the spread of BMP signaling throughout the cartilage is a certainty and the underlying cause for age-induced OA.

Ion channels are modulated by regulatory subunits, forming channelosomes. One such regulatory family are leucine-rich glioma-inactivated proteins (Lgi1-4), which interact with and modulate Kv1 in neurons. However, their impact in the heart remains unknown. We investigated the role of Lgi proteins in cardiac electrophysiology, focusing on IKur, and their contribution to the pathophysiology of AF. Methods: We used three complementary biological systems, including cell lines, AAV-mediated cardiac-specific Lgi4 mice (Lgi4 mice), and human samples from patients in sinus rhythm (SR) and AF. Our multidisciplinary approach included immunolocalization, patch-clamp, surface ECG, intracardiac stimulation, and molecular biology techniques. Results: Only Lgi3 and Lgi4 were expressed in human heart. In human atrium and heterologous cells, Lgi3 and Lgi4 interacted with Kv1.5 channels. In HEK293 cells, Lgi3-4 impaired Kv1.5/Kv{beta} association, partially reversing the Kv{beta}-induced N-type inactivation and reducing IKur amplitude. On surface ECG, the QRS interval was prolonged, and impulse conduction was impaired in Lgi4 mice compared to control. In isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from Lgi4 mice, early action potential repolarization was prolonged compared to control. These results correlated with the reduced Kv1.5 membrane expression and IKur density observed in Lgi4 cardiomyocytes and HEK293 cells. Notably, Lgi4 protein expression was lower in atrial tissue from patients with AF than SR. The reduction of Lgi4 in AF was associated with an altered colocalization with Kv1.5 channels, suggesting potential disruptions in their functional interactions. Conclusions: Lgi3-4 proteins are new components of KV1.5 channelosome. They modulate IKur by interfering with Kv1.5 interaction with Kv{beta}. Importantly, Lgi4 is dysregulated differently in paroxysmal versus permanent AF. The results improved the understanding of this most common type of arrhythmia and identified Lgi proteins as a new potential target for AF treatment.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616297", "title": "PII1/MRC interaction with Starch Synthase 4 (SS4) from Arabidopsis thaliana inhibits SS4 enzymatic activity", "authors": "Bossu, M.; Osman, R.; Brysbaert, G.; Lensink, M.

It accumulates in the form of insoluble, partly crystalline granules whose number and shape are specific to each plant species. These characteristics are defined very early in starch biosynthesis, at the initiation stage. Starch biosynthesis initiation is a complex process that relies on the coordinated action of several proteins that interact together in the so-called complex of initiation. Starch Synthase 4 (SS4) is the only initiation protein with enzymatic activity. It catalyzes the formation of glucan primers, which serve as substrates for the enzymatic machinery that synthesizes starch granules. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of interactions between SS4 and regulatory proteins in this process. Among them, Protein Involved in Initiation 1 (PII1) interacts with SS4 but its function is not yet established. In this study, we explored the structural and functional implications of PII1 on SS4's enzymatic activity. Our findings reveal that PII1 contains a long coiled-coil domain that specifically interacts with SS4, leading to significant inhibition of SS4's glucan elongation activity. Importantly, this inhibition is specific to SS4 and does not affect other known synthases, suggesting a targeted regulatory mechanism.

While functions of individual lipids have been extensively studied, understanding how lipidomes collectively contribute to membrane function and cell phenotypes is experimentally challenging in most organisms. To address this challenge, we turned to the simple pathogenic organism Mycoplasma mycoides and its genomically derived Minimal Cell JCVI-syn3B, to establish a living minimal membrane model system in which lipidome complexity can be experimentally manipulated. By complexing lipids with cyclodextrins, we introduce a chemically defined approach to deliver lipid 'diets' with different chemistries to cells, resulting in cellular lipidomes with as few as seven to nearly 30 lipids species. We explored how lipidome size and composition influences cell growth, osmotic sensitivity, and membrane adaptability to changes in growth temperature. Our findings indicate that lipidome composition dictates membrane adaptation to temperature change. Moreover, we show that lipidome diversity enhances cellular robustness to hypoosmotic shock. We further show that impaired acyl chain remodeling in the minimal cell is associated with impaired membrane temperature adaptation.

We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBM's TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics.

The mechanisms underlying the development of different cell types remain elusive. Single-cell transcriptomics provides the capacity to systematically study cell types across the entire temporal range of cortical development. Here, we present a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and epigenomic cell type atlas of the developing mouse visual cortex. The atlas was built from a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of 568,674 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes and a single-nucleus Multiome dataset of 194,545 high-quality nuclei providing both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles, densely sampled throughout the embryonic and postnatal developmental stages from E11.5 to P56. We computationally reconstructed a transcriptomic developmental trajectory map of all excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal cell types in the visual cortex, identifying branching points marking the emergence of new cell types at specific developmental ages and defining molecular signatures of cellular diversification. In addition to neurogenesis, gliogenesis and early postmitotic maturation in the embryonic stage which gives rise to all the cell classes and nearly all subclasses, we find that increasingly refined cell types emerge throughout the postnatal differentiation process, including the late emergence of many cell types during the eye-opening stage (P11-P14) and the onset of critical period (P21), suggesting continuous cell type diversification at different stages of cortical development. Throughout development, we find cooperative dynamic changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in specific cell types, identifying both chromatin peaks potentially regulating the expression of specific genes and transcription factors potentially regulating specific peaks. Furthermore, a single gene can be regulated by multiple peaks associated with different cell types and/or different developmental stages. Collectively, our study provides the most detailed dynamic molecular map directly associated with individual cell types and specific developmental events that reveals the molecular logic underlying the continuous refinement of cell type identities in the developing visual cortex.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616832", "title": "Differential Speed and Accuracy Trade-off in Working Memory Retrieval and Bilateral Precuneus between Older Men and Women", "authors": "Esiaka, D.; Strothkamp, S.; Banafsheh, A.; Broster, L.; Powell, D.

Emerging evidence suggests that the precuneus, a key region of the default mode network, is linked to internally focused processes like memory retrieval. This study examined sex differences in the relationship between precuneus volumes and working memory retrieval speed in cognitively normal older adults, hypothesizing that disparities in precuneus size and function contribute to reduced working memory performance in older women.\n\nMethodA cohort of participants (N=45; 25 women; Mage =77) from the University of Kentucky Alzheimers Disease Research Center completed the Bluegrass Working Memory Task while undergoing 3T Siemens magnetic resonance imaging scans.\n\nResultApplying Spearman correlation analyses, the results revealed correlations between working memory accuracy and volumes in the left (r=-.43, p<.01) and right (r=-.36, p<.05) precuneus across all subjects. Sex difference analysis indicated a tendency for the accuracy of the memory task to correlate more frequently with the left precuneus in women (r= 0.54; p < 0.05) than in men. Similarly, volumes in the left precuneus displayed a significant negative correlation with reaction time in response to memory target (r = -0.426; p < 0.05) and memory distractor (r = -0.549; p < 0.01) in women. There is a sex difference in accuracy and speed trade-off. While men were faster in reaction time, women were better in the accuracy of the memory task. Particularly noteworthy was the consistent association in women, where neurocognitive measures (Trail A, r= -.50, p<.01; Trail B, r= -.06, p<.01) reliably correlated with volumes in the left precuneus--a relationship not observed in men.\n\nDiscussionOur findings suggest that the left precuneus volume is associated with processing speed and accuracy of working memory performance, especially in women. Given that the left precuneus plays a key role in supporting various aspects of cognition, including memory retrieval, our findings point to the potential of reaction time serving as a surrogate marker for fMRI in predicting cognitive decline, particularly when considering sex differences.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.02.616345", "title": "Genetic diversity and population structure of soybean (Glycine max (L.)

However, its yield in Africa is less than half the global average resulting in low production, which is inadequate for satisfying the continent's needs. To address this disparity in productivity, it is crucial to develop new high-yielding cultivars by utilizing the genetic diversity of existing germplasms. Consequently, the genetic diversity and population structure of various soybean accessions were evaluated in this study. In pursuit of this objective, a collection of 147 soybean accessions was genotyped via the Diversity Array Technology Sequencing method. This method enables high-throughput analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), resulting in the identification of 7,083 high-quality SNPs distributed throughout the soybean genome. The average values observed for polymorphism information content (PIC), minor allele frequency, expected heterozygosity and observed heterozygosity were 0.277, 0.254, 0.344, and 0.110, respectively. The soybean genotypes were categorized into four groups on the basis of model-based population structure, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis of the principal component. Alternatively, hierarchical clustering was used to organize the accessions into three distinct clusters. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that the genetic variance within the populations exceeded the variance among them. The insights gained from this study will assist breeders in selecting parental lines for genetic recombination.

Developing an efficient framework for improving DBP prediction in plants would enable precise gene expression control, accelerate crop improvement, enhance stress resilience, and optimize metabolic engineering for agricultural advancement.

We employed molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling methods, and machine learning to classify Exon-19 deletion mutations into two profiles based on their conformational dynamics. Profile 1 mutations display only localized motions in key subdomains in their fluctuations about the equilibrium state, and a high affinity for ATP and consequent resistance to TKIs, while profile 2 mutations show reduced ATP binding affinity due to delocalized motion characterized by an increased flexibility between the N- and C-lobes of the EGFR kinase domain. This structural flexibility perturbs the ATP binding site, leading to decreased affinity and, heightened sensitivity to TKIs.

Notable examples include influenza viruses and coronaviruses, which have pandemic potential. Filo- and henipaviruses cause more limited outbreaks, but with high case fatality rates. All RNA viruses rely on the activity of a virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). An antiviral nucleoside analogue, 4'-Fluorouridine (4'-FlU), targets RdRp and diminishes the replication of several RNA viruses, including influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, through incorporation into nascent viral RNA and delayed chain termination. However, the effective concentration of 4'-FlU varied among different viruses, raising the need to fortify its efficacy. Here we show that inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis, can synergistically enhance the antiviral effect of 4'-FlU against influenza A viruses, SARS-CoV-2, henipaviruses, and Ebola virus. Even 4'-FlU-resistant mutant influenza A virus was re-sensitized towards 4'-FlU by DHODH inhibition. The addition of uridine rescued influenza A virus replication, strongly suggesting uridine depletion as a mechanism of this synergy. 4'-FlU was also highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 in a hamster model of COVID.

Numerous approaches are now available worldwide to dissect the contribution of genes of interest in biological processes. However, many of these approaches can be fastidious, difficult to perform and time-consuming, especially when working with slow-growing mycobacteria or in bio-safety level two/three settings. The recent development of CRISPRi-mediated targeted gene repression has revolutionized the way research groups can perform genetics in mycobacteria, providing a fast, robust and efficient alternative to study the function of specific genes including essential genes. In this research letter, we report the development and validation of a new subset of fluorescence-based CRISPRi tools for our scientific community. The pJL series is directly derived from the original integrative pIRL2 and pIRL117 CRISPRi vectors and conserved all the elements required to perform inducible targeted gene repression. In addition, these vectors carry two distinct fluorescent markers for which the expression is driven by the strong and constitutive promotor psmyc to simplify the selection of recombinant clones. We demonstrate the functionality of these vectors by targeting the expression of the non-essential glycopeptidolipid translocase mmpL4b and the essential genes rpoB and mmpL3. Finally, we describe an efficient single-step procedure to co-transform mycobacterial species with this integrative genetic tool alongside replicative vectors.

We show that fast-rotor MNMs kill up to 97% of M. smegmatis and co-localize with the bacteria as part of their mechanism of action. The ability to translate these observations to pathogenic mycobacteria was demonstrated by the ability of MNMs to kill 93.5% of M. tuberculosis under similar conditions.

In yeast, a similar mechanism exists whereby monocistronic mRNAs are selectively assembled into ribonucleoprotein particles, termed RNA operons or transperons, to regulate the expression of genes involved in the same biological process. One example is the heat shock protein (HSP) transperon that confers the eukaryotic heat shock response (HSR), a conserved cellular mechanism that enables organisms to cope with proteotoxic stress. As it was unknown whether transperons exist in higher eukaryotes, we examined whether a similar mechanism operates in mammalian cells. Using both single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and RNA pulldown techniques, we show that mammalian HSP mRNAs colocalize and multiplex to form mRNA assemblages during heat stress. These RNP assemblies are dependent on heat shock factor 1 transcriptional regulator and involve both inter- and intrachromosomal interactions among the HSP genes. Bioinformatic analysis identifies a conserved sequence motif within the coding regions of HSP mRNAs and mutational studies in yeast suggest that it is critical for mRNA multiplexing and the HSR. These findings emphasize the evolutionarily conserved nature of heat shock gene regulation across species and suggest that mammalian cells employ RNA operons/transperons in organizing their heat shock response.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.616900", "title": "Fn14 signaling regulates satellite cell self-renewal and expansion during adult skeletal muscle repair", "authors": "Tomaz Da Silva, M.; Joshi, A.

Individual deletions of these regulators result in populations with altered mean cell volumes. However, size homeostasis remains largely intact. Here, we show that although the roles of Bck2 and Cln3 for cell size regulation appear largely redundant in steady-state, a switch from fermentable to non-fermentable growth media reveals a unique role for Bck2 in cell size adaptation to changing nutrients. We use live-cell microscopy and machine learning-assisted image analysis to track single cells and their progeny through the nutrient switch. We find that after the switch, bck2del cells experience longer cell cycle arrests and more arrest associated enlargement than wild-type, whi5del or cln3del cells, indicating that Bck2 becomes the critical G1/S activator in changing nutrients.

Yet empirical observations show that some TEs, such as the P-element, insert into piRNA clusters preferentially. We were thus wondering if such a bias could be beneficial for the TE, for example by minimizing harm to the host while still being able to selfishly spread in populations. We decided to model insertion bias to determine if there was ever a situation in which insertion bias was beneficial to the TE. We performed extensive forward simulations of TE invasions with differing insertion biases into piRNA clusters. We found that insertion bias significantly altered the invasion dynamics of TEs, primarily by changing the copy number of the TE in individuals prior to silencing. Insertion into a piRNA cluster reduced the deleterious effects of TEs to the host population, but we found that TEs avoiding piRNA clusters out-compete TEs with a bias towards cluster insertions. Insertion bias was only beneficial to the TE when there was negative selection against TEs and a lack of recombination. Different TEs show different insertion biases into piRNA clusters suggesting they are an attribute of the TE not the host, yet scenarios in which this is beneficial to the TE are quite limited.

This compares, and shares, complications with cytometric (Cym) and related molecular measurements of genome size and contents.

Gnodes is the measurement tool used, which maps DNA to assembly, and measures DNA copy numbers for major genome contents of genes, transposons, repeats, and others, using as a measurement unit the single copies of unique conserved genes. Public data of five well studied genomes, human, corn, zebrafish, sorghum and rice, are used for the primary evidence of this work. Results of this are mixed and open to interpretations: In broad terms, all DNA types measure about the same genome contents, at or below 90% agreement, which is a level that the other complications can contribute. For precision above a 90% level, long read types differ in supporting larger cytometric sizes (low accuracy reads), or smaller assembly sizes (high accuracy reads), with accurate short-reads roughly between. The weight of evidence suggests that low accuracy long reads are less biased for genome measurement, that high accuracy long reads have a bias of reduced duplications introduced by computational averaging or filtering.

The crystal structure of GpeC, combined with in silico calculations and site-directed mutagenesis, provides strong evidence for the extreme flexibility of intra-cyclic amino acids within the biaryl-cyclized tetrapeptide. This flexibility enables the substitution of any of the other 19 amino acids, indicating that GpeC is a robust and adaptable catalyst for biaryl cyclization, providing a valuable resource for the biocatalytic synthesis of complex macrocyclic compounds.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.616848", "title": "Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and its reaction intermediates with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pH-neutral high-strength plasma-activated water determines the antimicrobial activity against ESKAPE Pathogens", "authors": "Mukherjee, D.; Roy Chowdhury, A.; Ghosh, P.; Vishwa, N.; Rao, L.; Chakravortty, D.", "author_corresponding": "Dipshikha Chakravortty", "author_corresponding_institution": "Indian Institute of Science", "date": "2024-10-06", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "bioengineering", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/06/2024.10.06.616848.source.xml", "abstract": "Plasma activated water (PAW) has gained significant global recognition due to its diverse applications in the biomedical and food preservation industries. The interaction between plasma's ionized particles, comprising ions, electrons, and neutral atoms, and water molecules results in high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), making PAW effective across various medical and agricultural fields. Previous research has demonstrated that effectiveness of PAW largely depends on its acidic pH, which generates several nucleophilic oxidants or secondary reactive nitrogen intermediates, such as peroxynitrite, derived from primary ROS and RNS. In one of our earlier studies, we were successful in generation of PAW at a neutral pH, which is more practical for real world applications. In this research, we explored the potential of the neutral pH high strength buffered PAW (hsPAbW) as an antimicrobial agent against ESKAPE pathogens and investigated its mechanism of action. Our findings revealed that hsPAbW effectively reduced bacterial viability during their exponential growth phase. We demonstrated that the ROS in hsPAbW are insufficient to independently kill the bacteria. Instead, the RNS components of hs-PAbW can exert microbicidal effects either independently or through the formation of peroxynitrite intermediates, which lead to nitrotyrosine production. As a result, we eliminated the need for low pH to induce the antimicrobial effects of hsPAbW, making it more practical for real world applications. Finally, our study showed that hs-PAbW is more effective at killing bacteria than high doses (50 microgram/mL) of antibiotics like ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem.

Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a highly abundant bacterium in the human gut microbiota, has been linked to overall health and is decreased in several pathological conditions, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). F. prausnitzii has shown anti-inflammatory properties in human and mouse models, notably through the induction of IL-10 signaling. Here, we investigated which cell types from human blood and intestinal tissue are responsible for producing IL-10 induced by F. prausnitzii, and providing the first mechanistic insights. Methods. Immune cells isolated from human blood and intestinal lamina propria of patients with IBD and non-inflamed controls, were stimulated them with F. prausnitzii EXL01 strain or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and analysed by Legendplex, ELISA, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing (RNAseq), and Seahorse technology. Results. F. prausnitzii EXL01 strain induced the direct and dose-dependent production of IL-10 in CD14+ monocytes from the systemic circulation and intestinal tissue of IBD patients and non-inflamed controls, without inducing a pro-inflammatory response as compared to LPS stimulation. RNAseq analysis corroborated these results and revealed that F. prausnitzii EXL01 strain differentially affects cell energy metabolism compared to LPS. The anti-inflammatory response induced by F. prausnitzii in monocytes was dependent on mitochondrial respiration. Conclusion. F. prausnitzii induces an anti-inflammatory response and rewires energy metabolism in human monocytes, which might explain its beneficial impact on intestinal inflammation and human health in general.

The airway epithelial barrier defends against bacteremia and is dependent upon apical junctional complex (AJC) proteins such as E-cadherin. After mouse lung challenge, pneumolysin (PLY), a key Sp virulence factor, stimulates epithelial secretion of an inflammatory eicosanoid, triggering the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) that secrete high levels of neutrophil elastase (NE), thus promoting epithelial damage and systemic infection. Here, pulmonary E-cadherin staining of intratracheally inoculated mice revealed PLY-mediated disruption of AJC independently of PMNs. Apical infection of air-liquid interface (ALI) respiratory epithelial monolayers similarly showed that PLY disrupts AJCs. This epithelial damage promoted PMN transmigration and bacterial apical-to-basolateral translocation, and pharmacologically fortifying epithelial barrier function diminished both barrier breach in vitro and bacteremia in vivo. E-cadherin staining after Sp intratracheal inoculation of >20-month-old mice, or apical infection of ALI monolayers derived from these mice, revealed an age-associated vulnerability to PLY-mediated AJC disruption, which in turn enhanced PMN migration and bacteremia. In addition, we found that PMNs from aged mice secrete increased levels of tissue-damaging NE. Simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of tissue-destructive NE and fortification of pulmonary epithelial barrier function was required to reduce the level of Sp bacteremia in aged mice to that of young mice.

Plant-fungal connectivity significantly declined with increasing land-use intensification, suggesting that managed ecosystems may have weakened root-fungal interactions. Network analysis highlights the distinct responses of various fungal groups. For instance, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) showed fewer connections with modules linked to oil palm and rubber roots, indicating weakened root-fungal associations in monocultures. This aligns with the observed reduction in AMF diversity in converted land-use areas compared to forests, further reinforcing the negative impact of land-use practices in oil palm and rubber monocultures on AMF diversity. Synthesis. Dimensioning the impacts of rainforest transformations belowground is constrained by our understanding of fungal functional guilds. Highly modified systems exhibited fewer connections, suggesting a dynamic restructuring of root-fungal relationships in response to land-use changes. Understanding the intricate interplay between plants and fungi in the face of land-use change can provide valuable information for conservation efforts, agricultural practices, and ecosystem management strategies aimed at promoting biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem resilience in the context of changing environmental conditions. Moreover, it underscores the importance of communities' networks in land-use planning and management decisions to support plant and fungal diversity in terrestrial ecosystems.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616827", "title": "Something to sink your teeth into: the mechanics of tooth indentation in frugivorous fishes", "authors": "Rosen, J.; Cohen, K.; Donatelli, C.

Vertebrate frugivores like primates and bats have particular morphologies, like wide jaws and blunt teeth, which are thought to aid in dismantling fruit and obtaining trapped sugars. However, variation among frugivores and fruits has made the identification of common frugivore phenotypes difficult. We measured the performance of frugivorous fish dentitions whether this performance was comparable to fruit-eating bats and primates. We also explored how fruit characteristics affect puncture performance, and how indentation of fruit differs mechanically from harder foods like nuts. Finally, we used photoelasticity and videography to visualize how serrasalmid dentitions propagate stresses in simple gel models. We expected that frugivore dentitions would exhibit low force and then high work when engaging fruit tissues. Aligning with our expectation, the most frugivorous serrasalmid we tested, Colossoma, had dental performance that matched the low force, high work model. Indentation behavior differed between food types, both between fruits and nuts, and among different fruits. We also documented considerable differences in the indentation performances of different serrasalmid dentitions, among frugivores, omnivores, and carnivores. We propose that some differences in the morphology of frugivore dentitions make them better for granivory (eating seeds) than the softer fruit tissues.

Our findings suggest that progenitor species' genomic legacies resulting from hybridization and whole-genome duplications conferred greater ecological adaptive advantages to Bh over Bs.

Phylogenetic analysis of GH23 lysozymes from all domains of life revealed a monophyletic radiation in animals.

Although numerous computational techniques have been developed to identify protein binding sites, serving as a valuable screening tool that reduces the time and cost associated with conventional experimental approaches, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy remains a formidable challenge. Recent advancements in protein structure prediction, notably through tools like AlphaFold, have made vast numbers of 3-D protein structures available, presenting an opportunity to enhance binding site prediction methods. The availability of detailed 3-D structures has led to the development of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can analyze complex spatial relationships in protein structures while maintaining invariance to rotations and translations. However, current equivariant GNN methods still face limitations in fully exploiting the geometric features of protein structures. To address this, we introduce E(Q)AGNN-PPIS, an Equivariant Attention- Enhanced Graph Neural Network designed for predicting protein binding sites by leveraging 3-D protein structure. Our method augments the Equivariant GNN framework by integrating an attention mechanism. This attention component allows the model to focus on the most relevant structural features for binding site prediction, significantly enhancing its ability to capture complex spatial patterns and interactions within the protein structure. Our experimental findings underscore the enhanced performance of E(Q)AGNN-PPIS compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, exhibiting gains of 8.33% in the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) and 10% in the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) across benchmark datasets.

Time-lapse imaging showed enhanced migration of resistant single cells and their collectives. Resistant cell spheroids spread faster on Collagen I substrata than sensitive controls. The resistant OVCAR-3 transcriptome was ontologically enriched for migration and showed overlap with previously reported markers of resistance in EOC patients and other evolved lines. Gene set enrichment predicted transition between epithelial, mesenchymal, and amoeboid states is higher in resistance compared to control lines. Lower matrix adhesion, weak focal adhesion, and highly deformable and translatory dynamics of cell collectives indicated that resistant cancer cells displayed a unique collective amoeboid-like migration. When injected intraperitoneally into immunodeficient mice, resistant cells colonized to a greater extent on parietal mucosae. Ex vivo, suspended resistant cells formed moruloids associated with quicker peritoneal adhesion, clearing human coelomic mesothelial monolayers with higher efficiency.

The resistance of Sphagnum biomass to decay is poorly understood but of high importance for preservation efforts and climate models. It is shown that peat cellulose and other glucose-rich polysaccharides are readily degradable by a commercial enzyme cocktail designed for the industrial saccharification of lignocellulose of vascular plants. However, prior hydrothermal pretreatment of peat was required for the enzymes to gain access to the polysaccharides. The pretreatment itself released monosaccharides and glucose-containing soluble oligosaccharides. The monosaccharide profile released from hydrothermal pretreatment was consistent with the expected hemicellulose content of Sphagnum and was clearly different from that seen for pretreated tissue from vascular plants, such as pretreated wheat straw. Cellulose retained in the insoluble part of peat was cleaved at a similar or higher rate compared to cellulose from vascular plant tissues. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the hydrothermal pretreatment disrupted the cells and relocated lignin-like compounds. Peat contains a high concentration of iron, which likely explains the pronounced acidification observed for the pretreated peat slurry at ambient conditions during saccharification assays. The acidification is due to abiotic oxidative reactions that also inactivate the enzymes. Adding catalase to the reactions alleviated enzyme inactivation and essentially stopped acidification during saccharification.

Prior prediction approaches have largely focused on metabolism, training machine learning models to solely predict on metabolic pathways. However, there are many other types of pathways in cells and organisms which are of interest to biologists; Methods: While several publications have made use of the metabolites and metabolic pathways available in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), we downloaded all the compound entries with pathway annotations available in KEGG. From this data, we constructed a dataset where each entry contained features representing compounds combined with features representing pathways followed by a binary label indicating whether the given compound is associated with the given pathway.

Songbirds that crystallize their repertoire of vocal syllables and transitions allow researchers to build probabilistic models of syntax rules, providing insight into underlying neural mechanisms. However, in many complex behaviors, syntax rules change over time, such as during learning or in response to new environmental and social contexts. In this study, we investigated the songs of canaries, a seasonal songbird species. Canaries learn a repertoire of 30-50 syllable types, produce syllables in repeat phrases, and organize these phrases into sequences with long-range syntactic dependencies. Since canaries are known to adapt their repertoire annually, we recorded their songs during the spring mating season and examined the syntactic properties that determine syllable sequencing. Over days and weeks, we observed changes in syllable usage rates, syllable numbers within phrases, phrase positions in songs, and in the long-range dependencies of phrase transitions. Acoustic features of syllables were also found to shift alongside these syntactic changes. Quantifying the variability of these properties revealed that the observed changes were not random. Most birds exhibited a clear trend of moving between order and disorder in their song's syntactic and acoustic features. Interestingly, this trend varied across individuals; some birds increased their stereotypy and decreased variability across days, while others adopted more disordered and variable song structures. These findings establish canaries as a valuable animal model for studying the neural mechanisms underlying syntax rules in complex motor sequences, their plasticity in social and environmental adaptation, and in implementing individual-specific strategies.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.616852", "title": "Targeting DNA-PK is a highly conserved poxvirus innate immune evasion mechanism", "authors": "Oliveira, M.; Manna, P.

Intracellular DNA sensing PRRs are responsible for initiating innate immune responses to poxviruses and other double-stranded DNA viruses. Poxviruses, in turn, encode an armoury of immunomodulators that inhibit this host defence mechanism. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is an essential component of the cGAS/STING-dependent viral DNA sensing machinery that leads to the initiation of a type-I interferon response during poxvirus infection. Poxviruses counter this host sensing mechanism using the C4/C10 family of proteins that target DNA-PK, interfering with its ability to bind viral DNA. Although the DNA-PK complex, known also for its role in double strand break repair, is conserved across multiple taxa, its function in innate immunity outside mammals is unexplored. Here we analysed the contribution of DNA-PK to poxvirus DNA sensing in chickens, a species that is evolutionarily distant from mammals, but that is also infected by poxviruses. We found that DNA-PK functions as a DNA sensor in chickens, and this process is countered by C4/C10 family members found in fowlpox virus. This host/pathogen interaction is conserved across a broader range of species than other mechanisms of poxvirus antagonism of innate immune sensing, which may reflect the difficulty of the host in evolving escape mechanisms that interfere with a protein that is essential for maintenance of genomic stability.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.616891", "title": "Decision analysis shows scientific and economic value of community-based monitoring in Madagascar", "authors": "Soifer, L.; Klinges, D.

We compare the number of species observed during scientist and community surveys, identify the 'ideal' number of scientist and community surveys that would be required to maximize the scientific and socioeconomic values of monitoring efforts while minimizing financial cost, and compare monitoring plans across several conservation philosophies representing 'ecocentric' and 'people-centered' perspectives. Scientists generally observed more species than community members. However, including a greater proportion of surveys conducted by community members improves wildlife monitoring across PAs, taxonomic groups, and diverse conservation philosophies due to the lower financial cost of travel and compensation relative to monitoring exclusively conducted by scientists. While the valuation schemes we use are simplistic representations of the complex costs and values associated with CBM, this study indicates the benefits of community monitoring regardless of the conservation philosophy used to anchor valuation and decision-making. Increasing integration of CBM into existing conservation management could therefore offer a financially viable method to consistently monitor biodiversity and benefit local communities in the face of limited funding and global challenges.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616829", "title": "Genetic variation in male mate choice for large females in Drosophila melanogaster", "authors": "Freed, G.

Although this preference is well-documented at the species level, less is known about how this preference varies within species and whether there is standing genetic variation for male mate choice within populations. We used hemiclonal analysis in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to test for heritable genetic variation in pre- and post-copulatory components of male mate choice for large females. We found additive genetic variation for both forms of male choice: males from different hemiclone lines varied in the strength of their courtship preferences for large females and the degree to which they extended matings with large females. Although males from hemiclone lines with stronger courtship preferences for large females were more likely to mate with those females, there was no genetic correlation between pre- and post-copulatory components of male mate choice, suggesting that they are under independent genetic control.

BioSAS measurements are resolution-limited and through an inverse Fourier transform, the measured SAS intensities directly relate to the physical space occupied by the particles via the ()-distribution. Yet, this inverse transform of SAS data is canonicaly cast as an ill-posed, ill-conditioned problem requiring an indirect approach. Here, we show that with modern instrumentation and the application of information theory, the inverse transform of SAXS intensity data can be cast as a well-conditioned problem and that the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem is directly related to the Shannon number. By exploiting the oversampling enabled by modern detectors, a direct inverse Fourier transform of the SAXS data is possible provided the recovered information does not exceed the Shannon limit. The limit corresponds to the maximum number of significant singular values that can be recovered in a SAXS experiment suggesting the relationship between the Shannon limit and significant singular values is a fundamental property of band-limited inverse integral transform problems. An intrinsic challenge to the type of problem found in SAS, is identifying the best model while avoiding over-fitting. We propose a hybrid scoring function employing an information theory framework that assesses both the quality of the model-data fit as well as the quality of the recovered ()-distribution. The hybrid score utilizes the Akaike Information Criteria and Durbin-Watson ( ) statistic that considers model complexity, i.e., degrees-of-freedom and randomness of the model-data residuals.

At puberty, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) is activated by neuroendocrine changes in the brain. Central to this are Kiss1 neurons that produce kisspeptin, a neuropeptide which is a potent stimulator of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate region of the hypothalamus (Kiss1ARC) increase pulsatile secretion of GnRH at puberty. Other developmental maturational changes in the brain are often accompanied by neuronal plasticity changes but this has not been studied in Kiss1 neurons. Electrophysiological characterisation of Kiss1ARC neurons from female mice shows that these neurons undergo profound intrinsic plasticity at puberty with a critical window between 3 and 4 weeks. Immature Kiss1ARC neurons cannot sustain depolarisation-evoked firing for even 500 ms and instead fire a brief burst of high frequency spikes before falling silent. This would make them unsuitable for the sustained activity that is needed to activate GnRH neurons and trigger LH secretion in the HPG axis. After puberty, sustained firing can be maintained, which endows post-puberty Kiss1ARC neurons with a mature physiological phenotype that is amenable to neuropeptide modulation for generation of burst firing and pulsatile release of kisspeptin. There is a corresponding decrease in the threshold for action potential initiation, a more hyperpolarised post-spike trough and a larger medium after-hyperpolarisation (mAHP). Gene expression analysis showed a significant decrease in Scn2a (Nav1.2 channel), Kcnq2 (Kv7.2 channel) and Lrrc55 (BK channel auxiliary {gamma}3-subunit) expression and an increase in Hcn1 (hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel) expression which may contribute to the observed electrophysiological changes.

Several cofactors have been identified that aid in DNA binding of RelA. In this study, we identify NME1 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1) as a cofactor that enhances RelAs ability to bind {kappa}B sites within the promoters of a subset of its target genes, promoting their expression under both unstimulated and stimulated conditions. Depletion of NME1 influences activation or repression of several genes that are unresponsive to TNF, despite containing {kappa}B sites in their promoters but not in clusters. This suggests that clustering of kB sites may be necessary for RelA-dependent transcription complex assembly. NME1 appears to act as a cofactor for other transcription factors to regulate these genes. NME1 does not directly contact {kappa}B DNA but interacts with RelA, with this interaction being further strengthened in the presence of {kappa}B DNA. Notably, NME1 alone has a marginal effect in enhancing RelAs DNA binding, suggesting that NME1 likely cooperate with other cofactors to regulate DNA binding and transcription through RelA.

Older people with epilepsy generally respond well to antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, whether specific ASMs can differentially control seizures in AD is unknown. The corneal kindled mouse model of acquired chronic secondarily generalized focal seizures allows for precisely timed drug administration studies to quantify the efficacy and tolerability of ASMs in an AD-associated genetic model. We hypothesized that mechanistically distinct ASMs would exert differential anticonvulsant activity and tolerability in aged AD mice (8-15 months) to define whether rational ASM selection may benefit specific AD genotypes. METHODS: Aged male and female PSEN2-N141I versus age-matched non-transgenic control (PSEN2 control) C57Bl/6J mice, and APPswe/PS1dE9 versus transgene negative (APP control) littermates underwent corneal kindling to quantify latency to fully kindled criterion. Dose-related ASM efficacy was then compared in each AD model versus matched control over 1-2 months using ASMs commonly prescribed in older adults with epilepsy: valproic acid, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and gabapentin. RESULTS: Sex and AD genotype differentially impacted seizure susceptibility. Male PSEN2-N141I mice required more stimulations to attain kindling criterion (X2=5.521; p<0.05). Male APP/PS1 mice did not differ in kindling rate versus APP control mice, but they did have more severe seizures. There were significant ASM class-specific differences in acute seizure control and dose-related tolerability. APP/PS1 mice were more sensitive than APP controls to valproic acid, levetiracetam, and gabapentin. PSEN2-N141I mice were more sensitive than PSEN2 controls to valproic acid and lamotrigine. DISCUSSION: AD genotypes may differentially impact ASMs activity and tolerability in vivo with advanced biological age.

Functional interneurons must integrate multiple features, including combinatorial transcription factor (TF) expression, axon/dendrite morphology, and connectivity to properly specify interneuronal identity. Yet, how these different interneuron properties are coordinately regulated remains unclear. Here we used the Drosophila neural progenitor, NB5-2, known to generate late-born interneurons in a proprioceptive circuit, to determine if the early-born temporal transcription factor (TTF), Hunchback (Hb), specifies early-born interneuron identity, including molecular profile, axon/dendrite morphology, and presynapse targeting. We found that prolonged Hb expression in NB5-2 increases the number of neurons expressing early-born TFs (Nervy, Nkx6, and Dbx) at the expense of late-born TFs (Runt and Zfh2); thus, Hb is sufficient to promote interneuron molecular identity. Hb is also sufficient to transform late-born neuronal morphology to early-born neuronal morphology. Furthermore, prolonged Hb promotes the relocation of late-born neuronal presynapses to early-born neuronal presynapse neuropil locations, consistent with a change in interneuron connectivity. Finally, we found that prolonged Hb expression led to defects in proprioceptive behavior, consistent with a failure to properly specify late-born interneurons in the proprioceptive circuit.

In this study, we quantified acoustic rhythms across taxa and investigated their evolutionary history with regard to phylogeny and selective pressure. In 98 species from six classes, we tested the main factors likely to influence their communication rhythms: morphology, physiology, social complexity, mastication and detectability. Phylogenetic modeling did not confirm the influence of these species-specific factors, but rather point to a scenario where acoustic communication rhythms have been maintained around an optimum at around 3Hz in the biological (neuronal) delta range (1-4Hz) well before the mammals split.

For female rats, regulating the timing of sexual interactions is essential for optimizing mating satisfaction and enhancing the physiological conditions needed for successful fertilization. So far, traditional research on female sexual behavior has relied on a limited set of behavioral parameters, which has certain shortcomings. To address this, our study aimed to develop a more detailed behavioral framework for assessing temporal copulatory patterns in female rats. We compared fully receptive females and less-receptive females, while also investigating the effects of (R)-(+)-8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist known for its inhibitory impact on female sexual behavior. Additionally, we examined how sexual experience and pacing conditions influence these copulatory patterns. Our results revealed that female rats engage in structured patterns of sexual bouts and time-outs, with higher receptivity leading to more sexual bouts and shorter time-outs. This suggests that sexual bouts can be viewed as an indicator of copulatory intensity, while time-outs reflect motivation to continue mating. Sexual experience did not enhance sexual performance but did result in females receiving more copulatory events from males. Lastly, we found that the conditions under which mating occurs (paced vs. non-paced) may not significantly impact copulatory behavior in fully-receptive females but could be more relevant for less-receptive females. Despite this, paced mating conditions remain preferable for studying female sexual behavior.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.616972", "title": "Charge Scaling in Potassium Channel Simulations: Conductance, Ion Occupancy, Voltage Response, and Selectivity", "authors": "Hui, C.; de Vries, R.; Kopec, W.; de Groot, B.", "author_corresponding": "Wojciech Kopec", "author_corresponding_institution": "Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.07.616972.source.xml", "abstract": "Potassium (K+) channels are widely distributed in many types of organisms. Potassium channels combine high efficiency (K+ ions permeation rates ~100 pS) and exquisite K+/Na+ selectivity by a conserved selectivity filter (SF) with four adjacent potassium-binding sites. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, provide a detailed, atomistic mechanism of this sophisticated ion permeation. However, currently there are clear inconsistencies between computational and experimental predictions. Firstly, the ion occupancy of the SF in simulations is lower than expected (~2.5 in MD compared to ~4 in X-ray crystallography). Secondly, in many reported MD simulations of K+ channels, K+ conductance is typically an order of magnitude lower than experimental values from single-channel electrophysiology. This discrepancy is in part because the force fields used in MD simulations of potassium channels do not account for explicit electronic polarization. One of the proposed solutions is the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC), a force field modification that scales down formal atomic charges, to introduce the polarization in a mean-field way. In this work, we apply the ECC to MD simulations of K+ channels under applied voltage. When the ECC is used in conjunction with the Charmm36m force field, the simulated K+ conductance increases 13-fold, whereas applying the ECC to Amber14 seemingly has no major effect. Following the analysis of ion occupancy states using Hamiltonian Replica Exchange (HRE) simulations, we propose a new parameter set for Amber14sb, that leads to a similar increase in conductance. These two force fields are then used to compute, for the first time, the full current-voltage (I-V) curves from MD simulations, approaching quantitative agreement with experiments at all voltages tested, for three K+ channels. In all simulated systems, the direct knock-on permeation mechanism with near-full K+ ion occupancy of the SF is consistently observed. In general, our ECC-enabled simulations are in excellent agreement with experimental data, in terms of ion occupancy, conductance, current-voltage response, and K+/Na+ selectivity. These simulations thus form a robust basis to study structure-function relations in K+ channels on the atomistic level with unprecedented accuracy, as exemplified by deciphering the rectification mechanism of the MthK channel.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.616944", "title": "Autonomous adaptive optimization of NMR experimental conditions for precise inference of minor conformational states of proteins based on chemical exchange saturation transfer", "authors": "Kasai, T.; Kigawa, T.", "author_corresponding": "Takanori Kigawa", "author_corresponding_institution": "RIKEN", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by", "category": "biophysics", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.07.616944.source.xml", "abstract": "In scientific experiments where measurement sensitivity is a major limiting factor, optimization of experimental conditions, such as parameters of measurement instruments, is essential to maximize the information obtained per unit time and the number of experiments performed.

One approach to this involves sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design, which adopts mutual information as the utility function to be maximized. In this study, we applied this optimization method to the chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) experiment in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which is used to study minor but functionally important invisible states of certain molecules, such as proteins. Adaptive optimization was utilized because prior knowledge of minor states is limited. To this end, we developed an adaptive optimization system of 15N-CEST experimental conditions for proteins using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)to calculate the posterior distribution and utility function. To ensure the completion of MCMC computations within a reasonable period with sufficient precision, we developed a second-order approximation of the CEST forward model. Both simulations and actual measurements using the FF domain of the HYPA/FBP11 protein with the A39G mutation demonstrated that the adaptive method outperformed the conventional one in terms of estimation precision of minor-state parameters based on equal numbers of measurements.

Here, we utilize multimodal magnetic resonance neuroimaging to investigate changes in regional network connectivity and neurovascular dynamics as the brain transitions from wakefulness to dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, and finally into early-stage recovery of consciousness. We observed widespread decreases in functional connectivity strength across the whole brain, and targeted increases in structure-function coupling (SFC) across select networks -- especially the cerebellum -- as individuals transitioned from wakefulness to hypnosis. We also observed robust decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) across the whole brain -- especially within the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum. Moreover, hypnosis was characterized by significant increases in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent signal, localized within visual and somatomotor regions. Critically, when transitioning from hypnosis to the early stages of recovery, functional connectivity strength and SFC -- but not CBF -- started reverting towards their awake levels, even before behavioral arousal. By further testing for a relationship between connectivity and neurovascular alterations, we observed that during wakefulness, brain regions with higher ALFF displayed lower functional connectivity with the rest of the brain. During hypnosis, brain regions with higher ALFF displayed weaker coupling between structural and functional connectivity. Correspondingly, brain regions with stronger functional connectivity strength during wakefulness showed greater reductions in CBF with the onset of hypnosis. Earlier recovery of consciousness was associated with higher baseline (awake) levels of functional connectivity strength, CBF, and ALFF, as well as female sex. Across our findings, we also highlight the role of the cerebellum as a recurrent marker of connectivity and neurovascular changes between states of consciousness.

We found that combining rs-fMRI and CMRO2 led to satisfactory prediction of individual Ki variance (45%).

Researchers have sought to bridge this gap by treating the post-stroke prognostic problem as a machine learning problem. Consistent with the observation that these impairments are caused by the brain damage that stroke survivors suffer, information concerning where and how much lesion damage they have suffered conveys useful prognostic information for these models. Much recent research has considered how best to encode this lesion information, to maximise its prognostic value. Here, we consider an encoding that, while not novel, has never before been formally examined in this context: 'continuous lesion images', which encode continuous evidence for the presence of a lesion, both within and beyond what might otherwise be considered the boundary of a binary lesion image. Current state of the art models employ information derived from binary lesion images. Here, we show that those models are significantly improved (i.e., with smaller Mean Squared Error between predicted and empirical outcome scores) when using continuous lesion images to predict a wide range of cognitive and language outcomes from a very large sample of stroke patients. We use further model comparisons to locate the predictive advantage to the provision of continuous lesion evidence beyond the boundary of binary lesion images. The continuous lesion images thus provide a straightforward way to incorporate details of both lesioned and non-lesioned tissue when predicting outcomes after stroke.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.616981", "title": "Local cytokine changes in response to mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles-based therapy in rat spinal cord injury", "authors": "Kabdesh, I.; Garanina, E.; Kostennikov, A.; Rizvanov, A.; Mukhamedshina, Y.", "author_corresponding": "Ilyas Kabdesh", "author_corresponding_institution": "Kazan (Volga region) Federal University", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.07.616981.source.xml", "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs), encapsulated in a fibrin matrix (FM), on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) 60 days post-injury. Methods: MSCs were isolated from rat adipose tissue and cultured to obtain MSC-EVs using cytochalasin B. MSC-EVs encapsulated in the FM were applied to the injury site at doses of 5 and 10 ug. Four experimental groups included SCI without treatment, SCI with FM application, and SCI with FM+EVs at 5 and 10 ug doses. A multiplex assay was conducted to measure 23 cytokines in spinal cord tissue homogenates. Results: FM application to the injury site exhibited both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine shifts, with the most pronounced effect for G-CSF (2.8-fold) potentially due to the hemostatic properties of the FM. MSC-EVs led to significant modulation of cytokine levels. In the SCI FM+EVs10 group, concentrations of IL-10, IL-1b, IL-5, and IL-17A were significantly lower compared to the SCI and SCI FM groups. Here the most pronounced change was observed for IL-10, which decreased by 2.4-fold.

Circadian output neurons are a group of neurons that receive input from the central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the mammalian brain and transmit timing information to different regions of the brain and body, coordinating the circadian rhythms of various physiological processes. In Drosophila, an important set of circadian output neurons are called pars intercerebralis (PI) neurons, which receive input from specific clock neurons called DN1. These neurons can further be subdivided into functionally and anatomically distinctive anterior (DN1a) and posterior (DN1p) clusters. The neuropeptide diuretic hormones 31 (Dh31) and 44 (Dh44) are the insect neuropeptides known to activate PI neurons to control activity rhythms. However, the neurophysiological basis of how Dh31 and Dh44 affect circadian clock neural coding mechanisms underlying sleep in Drosophila is not well understood. Here, we identify Dh31/Dh44-dependent spike time precision and plasticity in PI neurons. We find that the application of synthesized Dh31 and Dh44 affects membrane potential dynamics of PI neurons in the precise timing of the neuronal firing through their synergistic interaction, possibly mediated by calcium-activated potassium channel conductance. Further, we characterize that Dh31/Dh44 enhances postsynaptic potentials in PI neurons.

Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence, perspective, and presenting biological/non-biological stimuli. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Method: Experiment 1 was a reaction time task (n=29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person) and stimulus type (biological or non-biological). Experiment 2 (n=50) used the same stimuli in a Forced Response paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Results: Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer reaction times and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for biological stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent biological stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for non-biological stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Discussion: Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during action observation. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, while anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between biological and non-biological stimuli.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.616911", "title": "Multiple context discrimination in adult rats: sex variability and dynamics of time-dependent generalization of an aversive memory", "authors": "Alves, F.

In this work, we aimed to investigate how rats of both sexes discriminate among multiple contexts gradually differentiated in similarity to the conditioning one, two days after training.

With a second set of contexts, sorted according to other criteria, only males, at the 2 days interval, attained a staircase-like response to the successive contexts, while females displayed a completely different freezing pattern; in remote tests, 28 and 45 days later, freezings grouped into two levels, suggesting a partial time-dependent generalization for some of the contexts.

Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels on sensory neurons underly responsiveness to mechanical stimuli. The study aimed to address gaps in knowledge regarding MA current properties in higher order species such as non-human primates (NHP; common marmosets), and characterization of MA currents in trigeminal (TG) neuronal subtypes. Methods: We employed patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to associate MA current types to different marmoset TG neuronal groups. TG neurons were grouped according to presumed marker expression, action potential (AP) width, characteristic AP features, after-hyperpolarization parameters, presence/absence of AP trains and transient outward currents, and responses to mechanical stimuli. Results: Marmoset TG were clustered into 5 C-fiber and 5 A-fiber neuronal groups. The C1 group likely represent non-peptidergic C-nociceptors, the C2-C4 groups resembles peptidergic C-nociceptors, while the C5 group could be either cold-nociceptors or C-low-threshold-mechanoreceptors (C-LTMR). Among C-fiber neurons only C4 were mechanically responsive. The A1 and A2 groups are likely A-nociceptors, while the A3-A5 groups probably denote different subtypes of A-low-threshold-mechanoreceptors (A-LTMRs). Among A-fiber neurons only A1 was mechanically unresponsive. IHC data was correlated with electrophysiology results and estimates that NHP TG has ~25% peptidergic C-nociceptors, ~20% non-peptidergic C-nociceptors, ~30% A-nociceptors, ~5% C-LTMR, and ~20% A-LTMR. Conclusion: Overall, marmoset TG neuronal subtypes and their associated MA currents have common and unique properties compared to previously reported data.

Hence, neurons that are lost due to neurodegenerative disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury or peripheral neuropathy cannot be replaced. Transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons provides a potential replacement strategy, but how these neurons can be encouraged to functionally integrate into circuits remains a significant challenge. In the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) continue to be generated throughout life from basal stem cells and can be repopulated even after complete ablation. However, the specialized population of navigator OSNs that ensures accurate odorant receptor-specific targeting of OSN axons to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB) is only present perinatally. Despite this, some studies have reported complete regeneration of specific glomeruli, while others have found various degrees of recovery, following OSN cell death. Variability in the extent of both initial OSN ablation and subsequent repopulation of the OE, and the focus on anatomical recovery, leave the extent to which newly generated OSNs can reinnervate the OB unclear. Here, we employed the olfactotoxic drug methimazole to selectively ablate OSNs without damaging the basal stem cells that generate them, enabling us to assess the extent of functional recovery of OSN input to the OB in the context of complete OSN repopulation. We found profound deficits in the recovery of odor-evoked responses in OSN axons in the glomerular layer of the dorsal OB five weeks after OSN ablation, a time point at which OSNs are known to have repopulated the OE. Histological analysis of mature OSN axons in the OB at 10 and 20 weeks post-methimazole showed a persistent region-specific deficit in OSN axon reinnervation of the dorsal OB, with the dorsomedial region being particularly adversely affected. In contrast, reinnervation of the ventral, lateral and medial regions of the OB was almost complete by 10 weeks post-MMZ. Hence, we have identified a region-specific deficit in OSN reinnervation of the mouse OB, which sets the stage to identify the mechanisms that mediate successful vs. unsuccessful axonal regeneration in an endogenous population of stem cell-derived neurons.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.616970", "title": "Presynaptic filopodia form kinapses and modulate membrane mechanics for synchronous neurotransmission and seizure generation.", "authors": "Jain, A.; Kroll, J.; Webster, J.

Filopodia generation requires neuronal activity, calcium and actin, and occurs in intact brain circuits and human brain. Mechanistically, their extension preserves synchronous neurotransmitter release by increasing presynaptic membrane tension.

Among many biological changes in chronically stressed brains, disruptions in AMPA Receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus are associated with stress responses. We have revealed that low-dose ketamine rapidly induces the expression of GluA1-containing, GluA2-lacking Ca2+-Permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), which enhances glutamatergic synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons. Additionally, subanesthetic low-dose ketamine decreases anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in naive animals. In addition to reducing depression, some research indicates that ketamine may have protective effects against chronic stress in both humans and animals. However, the role of CP-AMPARs in the actions of ketamine's antistress effects is largely unknown. Here, we use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in female and male hippocampal slices to affirm that subanesthetic low-dose ketamine treatment induces CP-AMPAR expression in these cells. Using multiple behavioral assays including reciprocal social interaction, contextual fear conditioning, and tail suspension test, we demonstrate that low-dose ketamine treatment reverses chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced social dysfunction, hippocampus-dependent fear memory loss, and depression-like behavior in both female and male mice. Furthermore, we show that the ketamine-induced antistress effects on these behaviors are dependent on CP-AMPAR expression.

The treatments included four levels of chicken manure (0, 5, 10 and 15 t/ha) and five levels of NPS fertilizer (0, 50,100, 150 and 200 kg/ha) arranged factorially using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and replicated three times. Growth, bulb yield and quality data were collected and subjected to analysis using SAS version 9.4. With the exception of days to maturity, leaf number and non-marketable bulb yield in the case of chicken manure, the majority of the investigated parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) impacted by the main effects of chicken manure and NPS fertilizer. Exception marketable and total bulb yield, the interaction impact was not significant for nearly all of the examined variables. On the other hand, the bulb yield was considerably raised by raising the rate of chicken manure in combination with NPS fertilizer. As a result, combined application of 15 t/ha chicken manure and 150 kg/ha NPS fertilizer produced the maximum marketable bulb (19.52 t/ha) and total yield (20.27 t/ha), followed by marketable yield (18.53 t/ha) and total yield (19.55 t/ha) obtained from plants treated with 200 kg/ha of NPS fertilizer and 15 t/ha of chicken manure, with a 927 % yield advantage over plants receiving no fertilizer.

The TLH thus predicts that as trees grow taller, treetop leaf cell size distributions should become increasingly narrowas selection pushes as close as possible toward the inaccessible, favored values with a right-hand threshold. To test this, we sampled 58 individuals of two tree species across different heights, along with 24 canopy-dominant rainforest species.

Conventional studies that solely focus on clinical symptoms or neuroimaging metrics often fail to capture the intricate relationship between these modalities, limiting their ability to disentangle the complexity in MDD. Moreover, patient neuroimaging data typically contains normal sources of variance shared with healthy controls, which can obscure disorder-specific variance and complicate the delineation of disease heterogeneity. Methods: We employed contrastive principal component analysis to extract disorder-specific variations in fMRI-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) by contrasting MDD patients (N=233) with age-matched healthy controls (N=285). We then applied sparse canonical correlation analysis to identify latent dimensions in the disorder variations by linking the extracted contrastive connectivity features to clinical symptoms in MDD patients. Results: Two significant and generalizable dimensions linking distinct brain circuits and clinical profiles were discovered. The first dimension, associated with an apparent internalizing-externalizing symptom dimension, was characterized by self-connections within the visual network and also associated with choice reaction times of cognitive tasks. The second dimension, associated with personality facets such as extraversion and conscientiousness typically inversely associated with depression symptoms, is primarily driven by self-connections within the dorsal attention network. This depression-protective personality dimension is also associated with multiple cognitive task performances related to psychomotor slowing and cognitive control. Conclusions: Our contrastive RSFC-based dimensional approach offers a new avenue to dissect clinical heterogeneity underlying MDD. By identifying two stable, neurophysiology-informed symptom dimensions in MDD patients, our findings may enhance disease mechanism insights and facilitate precision phenotyping, thus advancing the development of targeted therapeutics for precision mental health.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.614680", "title": "Hippocampal ripples during offline periods predict human motor sequence learning", "authors": "Chen, P.-C.; Stritzelberger, J.; Walther, K.; Hamer, H.; Staresina, B.", "author_corresponding": "Bernhard Staresina", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.06.614680.source.xml", "abstract": "High-frequency bursts in the hippocampus, known as ripples (80-120 Hz in humans), have been shown to support episodic memory processes.

We first demonstrate that ripple rates strongly increase during rest periods relative to training blocks.

Organisms rapidly colonize bare ground free from ice, and in less than a century complex ecosystems can develop in a process of primary succession, where community changes as terrain age increases and interactions within species change over time. When glaciers retreat the resulting ice-free soil is exposed to new forms of chemical and biological weathering, with initiating soil formation as an important driver of evolving ecosystems. Soils play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, serving as the largest reservoir of carbon. CO2 is removed from the atmosphere by plant photosynthesis, then stored in biomass and soils, and released again to the atmosphere via plant and soil respiration. Soil respiration includes CO2 production by heterotrophic soil organisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, invertebrates) that metabolize plant litter and soil organic matter, and autotrophs (e.g. plant roots). However, little is known about the development of soils, their physico-chemical changes, and their influence on plant diversity and soil carbon emission (CO2) after glacier retreat. This study aims to investigate how the retreat of the Mont Mine and Ferpecle glaciers (Valais Alps, Switzerland) influences soil functioning and vegetation development. For this purpose, we carried out soil analyses and vegetation surveys on 5 ice-free stages deglaciated between 1864 and 2023. Soil physico-chemical properties (pH, soil organic matter, organic carbon and nitrogen, granulometry, available elements, total elements), soil CO2 respiration fluxes, and plant communities (composition, diversity, richness, biomass) were studied in 20 plots along the glacier forefield. Our results show that vegetation develops according to the principles of primary succession, going further from glacier front: from pioneer vegetation 7 years after glacier retreat, progressing through early vegetation at 20 years, then to intermediate vegetation, and ultimately culminating in a climax coniferous forest, 140 years after glacier retreat. Over 140 years, the increase in vegetation productivity results in a greater transfer of organic matter (SOM) to the soil, which increases organic carbon, nitrogen, and nutrient levels, and decreases pH values as it releases organic acids. Aboveground plant biomass (i.e. carbon storage) increases over the succession, however, plant diversity and richness peak at the intermediate stages and then level off due to the dominance of few species in the late stages. At the intermediate stage, there is also a peak observed in soil respiration (CO2 flux), which in turn promotes plant colonization and diversity. Thus, the soil, along with its development stages and properties, plays a critical role in carbon accumulation, leading to an increased potential for carbon release as organic matter storage increases. This project aims to contribute to the understanding of the consequences of global warming on recently deglaciated ecosystems, which remain still poorly overlooked.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.04.616652", "title": "Unveiling the Origins and Genetic Makeup of the 'Forgotten People': A Study of the Sarmatian-Period Population in the Carpathian Basin", "authors": "Schu\u0308tz, O.; Maroti, Z.; Tihanyi, B.; Kiss P, A.; Nyerki, E.; Ginguta, A.; Kiss, P.; Varga, G.

Background: Electrical stimulation often generates significant signal artifacts that can obscure important physiological signals. Removal of the artifact and understanding latent information from these signals could provide objective measures of circuit engagement, potentially driving advancements in neuromodulation research and therapies. Methods: We conducted intracranial physiology studies on five consecutive patients with Parkin-son's disease who underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery as part of their routine care. Monopolar stimuli (either cathodic or anodic) were delivered in pairs through the DBS electrode across a range of inter-stimulus intervals. Recordings from adjacent unused electrode contacts used broadband sampling and precise synchronization to generate a robust template for the stimulus transient during the absolute refractory period. These templates of stimulus transient were then subtracted from recordings at different intervals to extract and analyze the residual neural potentials. Results: After artifact removal, the residual signals exhibited absolute and relative refractory periods with timing indicative of neural activity. Cathodic and anodic DBS pulses generated distinct patterns of local tissue activation, showing phase independence from the prior stimulus. The earliest detectable neural responses occurred at short peak latencies (ranging from 0.19 to 0.38 ms post-stimulus) and were completely or partially obscured by the stimulus artifact prior to removal. Cathodic stimuli produced stronger local tissue responses than anodic stimuli, aligning with clinical observations of lower activation thresholds for cathodic stimulation. However, cathodic and anodic pulses induced artifact patterns that were equivalent but opposite. Interpretation: The proposed artifact removal technique enhances prior approaches by allowing direct measurement of local tissue responses without requirements for stimulus polarity reversal, template scaling, or specialized filters. This approach could be integrated into future neuromodulation systems to visualize stimulus-evoked neural potentials that would otherwise be obscured by stimulus artifacts.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616805", "title": "Nutri Complex 150+: a new and effective approach to facial rejuvenation", "authors": "Privitera, A.; Ferruggia, G.; Contino, M.; Maugeri, S.; Zimbone, M.; Cardile, V.; Caruso, G.; Brundo, M.

This actin network represents a significant challenge for membrane deformation and scission, and how it is remodeled during the late steps of the viral cycle is largely unknown. Using super-resolution microscopy, we show that HIV-1 buds in areas of the plasma membrane with low cortical F-actin levels. We find that the cellular oxidoreductase MICAL1 locally depolymerizes actin at budding sites to promote HIV-1 budding and release. In the absence of MICAL1, F-actin abnormally remains at viral budding sites, incompletely budded viruses accumulate at the plasma membrane and viral release is impaired. Remarkably, normal viral release can be restored in MICAL1-depleted cells by inhibiting Arp2/3-dependent branched actin networks. Mechanistically, we find that MICAL1 directly disassembles branched-actin networks and controls the timely recruitment of the ESCRT scission machinery during viral budding. In addition, the MICAL1 activator Rab35 is recruited at budding sites, functions in the same pathway as MICAL1 and is also required for viral release. This work reveals a role for oxidoreduction in triggering local actin depolymerization to control HIV-1 budding, a mechanism that may be widely used by other viruses.

Using neuroblastoma cells as a model system, we show that ASCL1 exhibits cell cycle phase-dependent chromatin binding patterns. In cycling cells, S/G2/M phase-enriched binding occurs at promoters of transcribed pro-mitotic genes, while G1 phase-enriched binding of ASCL1 is associated with the priming of pro-neuronal enhancer loci. Prolonged G1 arrest is further required to activate these ASCL1-bound and primed neuronal enhancers to drive neuronal differentiation. Thus, we reveal that the same transcription factor can control distinct transcriptional programmes at different cell cycle stages, and demonstrate how lengthening of G1 allows engagement of a differentiation programme by turning unproductive factor binding into productive interactions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616797", "title": "Spike mRNA Vaccine Encapsulated in a Lipid Nanoparticle Composed of Phospholipid 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine Induced Potent B- and T-cell Responses Associated with Protection against COVID-19 in Hamsters", "authors": "Quadiri, A.; Prakash, S.; Zayou, L.; Dhanushkodi, N.; Chilukuri, A.; Ryan, G.; Wang, K.; Vahed, H.; BenMohamed, L.", "author_corresponding": "Lbachir BenMohamed", "author_corresponding_institution": "UC Irvine, School of Medicine", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "immunology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.05.616797.source.xml", "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have recently emerged as one of the most advanced vehicle platforms for efficient in vivo delivery of nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine, particularly for COVID-19.

Three different approaches have been used separately to address these limitations, including using transgenic Scnn1b-Tg mice overexpressing a lung epithelial sodium channel to mimic the mucus-rich and hyperinflammatory CF lung environment, using synthetic CF sputum medium (SCFM) in an acute infection to induce bacterial phenotypes consistent with human CF, or using agar beads to promote chronic infections.

Lung function measurements showed that infected SCFM-Tg-mice had decreased inspiratory capacity and compliance, elevated airway resistance, and significantly reduced FVC and FEV0.1. Using spectral flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays we show that, like people with CF, SCFM-Tg-mice developed inflammation characterized by eosinophil infiltration and Th2 lymphocytic cytokine responses. Chronically infected SCFM-Tg-mice developed an exacerbated mix of innate and Th1, Th2, and Th17-mediated inflammation, causing higher lung cellular damage, and elevated numbers of unusual Siglec F+ neutrophils.

GenomicGapID, a novel technique we have developed, has the potential to bridge this gap. By leveraging the conservation and relative positioning of highly conserved coding regions across different species, GenomicGapID enables the development of universal primer sets that amplify the non-conserved gaps between these regions. This creates a unique electrophoretic signature that facilitates rapid and accurate target agnostic microbial identification. In this study, we apply the principles of GenomicGapID to the critical task of identifying clinical pathogens. We first assembled a comprehensive database of 189 clinically relevant bacterial species. We then identified conserved primer binding sites that produce unique amplicon size signatures for each species. While we found that the use of amplicon size signatures alone would require an impractical number of universal primer sets, we demonstrate that this challenge can be effectively mitigated through concurrent melt analysis. Ultimately, we show that just three universal primer sets, guided by the GenomicGapID framework, are sufficient to cover all pathogens in the dataset, representing a majority of microbes identified in positive cultures in a clinical microbiology setting, with experimental validation of a subset of these pathogens.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.616878", "title": "Chronic infections can generate SARS-CoV-2-like bursts of viral evolution without epistasis", "authors": "Rodriguez-Horta, E.; Strahan, J.; Dinner, A.; Barton, J.

Monoclonal antibodies were shown to be effective, yet as the SARS-CoV-2 mutated, these antibodies became ineffective. Small molecule antivirals were identified using pseudovirus constructs to recapitulate infection in non-human cells, such as Vero E6 cells. However, the impact was limited due to poor translation of these compounds in the clinical setting. This is partly due to the lack of similarity of screening platforms to the in vivo physiology of the patient and partly because drugs effective in vitro showed dose-limiting toxicities.

We assembled and annotated a transcriptomic atlas of wS1 during postnatal development comprising 45 molecularly distinct neuronal types that can be grouped into eight excitatory and four inhibitory neuron subclasses. Using this atlas, we examined the influence of whisker experience from postnatal day (P) 12, the onset of active whisking, to P22, on the maturation of molecularly distinct cell types. During this developmental period, when whisker experience was normal, ~250 genes were regulated in a neuronal subclass-specific fashion. At the resolution of neuronal types, we found that only the composition of layer (L) 2/3 glutamatergic neuronal types, but not other neuronal types, changed substantially between P12 and P22. These compositional changes resemble those observed previously in the primary visual cortex (V1), and the temporal gene expression changes were also highly conserved between the two regions. In contrast to V1, however, cell type maturation in wS1 is not substantially dependent on sensory experience, as 10-day full-face whisker deprivation did not influence the transcriptomic identity and composition of L2/3 neuronal types. A one-day competitive whisker deprivation protocol also did not affect cell type identity but induced moderate changes in plasticity-related gene expression.

We also explore the roles of nuclear speckle scaffold factors, SON and SRRM2, in the biogenesis of these puncta. Through genetic manipulation and depletion experiments, we demonstrate the key role of the intrinsically disordered region of SRRM2 in enlarging nuclear speckles in the presence of the HIV capsid. We identify the FG domain of CPSF6 as essential for both puncta formation and binding to the viral core, which serves as the scaffold for CPSF6 puncta. While the low-complexity regions (LCRs) modulate CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid, they do not contribute to puncta formation, nor do the disordered mixed charge domains (MCDs) of CPSF6. These results demonstrate how HIV evolved to hijack host nuclear factors, enabling its persistence in the host. Of note, this study provides new insights into the underlying interactions between host factors and viral components, advancing our understanding of HIV nuclear dynamics and offering potential therapeutic targets for preventing viral persistence.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.06.616923", "title": "JunB-HBZ nuclear translocation by TGF-beta is a key driver in HTLV-1-mediated leukemogenesis", "authors": "Yasunaga, J.; Zhang, W.; Shichijo, T.; Chen, X.; Matsuoka, M.", "author_corresponding": "Junichirou Yasunaga", "author_corresponding_institution": "Kumamoto University", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.06.616923.source.xml", "abstract": "The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) gene, which is the only viral gene conserved and consistently expressed in all adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cases, is critical for ATL oncogenesis.

However, there are currently very little empirical data on the metabolic activity of uropathogens when grown in urine. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic survey of the metabolic activities of eight of the most common uropathogenic bacterial species that collectively represent 99% of uncomplicated UTIs. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses of human urine cultures revealed that uropathogens have four distinct metabolic clades. We generalized these clades as serine consumers (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis), glutamine consumers (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), amino acid abstainers (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), and amino acid minimalists (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus).

Competition assays in Drosophila also did not support any altered ability in immune evasion. Instead, using a panel of mutant flies defective for various immune components, we show that this daptomycin resistance-related attenuated virulence is mostly explained by greater susceptibility to activity of Drosophila prophenoloxidase, a tyrosinase involved in melanization, but not to antimicrobial peptides or to Bomanin antimicrobial effectors.

Human P. aeruginosa infections are predominantly caused by a small number of sequence types (ST), such as ST235, ST111, and ST175. Although ST111 is recognized as one of the most prevalent high-risk P. aeruginosa clones worldwide and frequently exhibits multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant phenotypes, the basis for this dominance remains unclear. In this study, we used a genome-wide transposon insertion library screen to discover that the competitive advantage of ST111 strains over certain non-ST111 strains is through production of R pyocins. We confirmed this finding by showing that competitive dominance was lost by ST111 mutants with R pyocin gene deletions. Further investigation showed that sensitivity to ST111 R pyocin (specifically R5 pyocin) is caused by deficiency in the O-antigen ligase waaL, which leaves lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bereft of O antigen, enabling pyocins to bind the LPS core. In contrast, sensitivity of waaL mutants to R1 or R2 pyocins depended on additional genomic changes. In addition, we found the PA14 mutants in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (waaL, wbpL, wbpM) that cause high susceptibility to R pyocins also exhibit poor swimming motility. Analysis of 5,135 typed P. aeruginosa strains revealed that several international, high-risk sequence types (including ST235, ST111, and ST175) are enriched for R5 pyocin production, indicating a correlation between these phenotypes and suggesting a novel approach for evaluating risk from emerging prevalent P. aeruginosa strains.

Salmonella must utilize diverse nutrients for growth in nutrient-poor macrophages, but which nutrients are required for intracellular Salmonella growth is largely unknown. Here, we found that either acquisition from the host or de novo synthesis of a nonprotein amino acid, beta-alanine, is critical for Salmonella replication inside macrophages. The concentration of beta-alanine is decreased in Salmonella-infected macrophages, while the addition of exogenous beta-alanine enhances Salmonella replication in macrophages, suggesting that Salmonella can uptake host-derived beta-alanine for intracellular growth. Moreover, the expression of panD, the rate-limiting gene required for beta-alanine synthesis in Salmonella, is upregulated when Salmonella enters macrophages. Mutation of panD impaired Salmonella replication in macrophages and colonization in the mouse liver and spleen, indicating that de novo synthesis of beta-alanine is essential for intracellular Salmonella growth and systemic infection. Additionally, we revealed that beta-alanine influences Salmonella intracellular replication and in vivo virulence by increasing expression of the zinc transporter genes znuABC, which in turn facilitates the uptake of the essential micronutrient zinc by Salmonella. Taken together, these findings highlight the important role of beta-alanine in the intracellular replication and virulence of Salmonella, and panD is a promising target for controlling systemic Salmonella infection.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.617030", "title": "DNA topoisomerase I acts as supercoiling sensor for transcription elongation in E. coli", "authors": "Vidmar, V.; Borde, C.; Bruno, L.; Takacs, M.; Batisse, C.; Saint-Andre, C.; Zhu, C.; Espeli, O.; Lamour, V.; Weixlbaumer, A.", "author_corresponding": "Valerie Lamour", "author_corresponding_institution": "Department of Integrated Structural Biology, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), Illkirch , France", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "molecular biology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.07.617030.source.xml", "abstract": "When DNA is transcribed to RNA, the DNA double helix is constantly unwound and rewound to provide access for RNA polymerase (RNAP).

These arboviruses have complex life cycles involving Aedes mosquitoes, driven by environmental, ecological, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. In Colombia, Aedes aegypti is the primary vector, but Aedes albopictus is expanding across the country. Understanding the unique characteristics of each species is crucial for managing arbovirus spread, particularly in areas where they coexist. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted an entomological survey of A. aegypti and A. albopictus (larvae, pupae, and adults) in urban and rural areas of four municipalities across different elevations (200-2200 meters above sea level) in Colombia. Household conditions and knowledge of DENV were assessed through interviews. Female A. albopictus were tested individually for arbovirus RNA, while A. aegypti were tested in pools. Both species were found up to 2100 masl. A. aegypti comprised 78% of the immature forms collected, while A. albopictus made up 22%. Larvae from both species coexisted in common artificial breeding sites in urban and rural areas, with no evidence of competition. A. albopictus preferred rural areas, lower elevations (<1500 masl), high precipitation (>270 mm), and poor household conditions, while A. aegypti was more abundant in urban areas, intradomicile environments, and areas with moderate precipitation (100-400 mm). Biting risk was higher for A. aegypti (0.02-0.22 females per person), particularly in urban areas, while A. albopictus exhibited lower biting risk (0.001-0.08), with the highest values in rural Patia. Natural infections of DENV (12.4%) and CHIKV (12.4%) were found in A. aegypti, while A. albopictus showed CHIKV (41.2%) and DENV (23%) infections, with virus dissemination to the legs and salivary glands. Conclusions/Significance Integrating household conditions and community knowledge with environmental data can enhance predictive models for vector presence and guide surveillance and educational strategies. Our findings highlight the need to consider A. albopictus as a potentially significant arbovirus vector in Colombia, especially given the presence of arboviruses in its salivary glands, its use of artificial breeding sites, its biting risk inside homes, and its differing ecological preferences and seasonal associations compared to A. aegypti.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.617064", "title": "Vocal communication is seasonal in social groups of wild, free-living house mice", "authors": "Jourjine, N.; Goedecker, C.; Ko\u0308nig, B.; Lindholm, A.

To determine cellular mechanisms that might contribute to these opposing phenotypes, we performed quantitative tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics on human dorsal forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from 16p11.2 CNV carriers. Differentially phosphorylated proteins between unaffected individuals and 16p11.2 CNV carriers were significantly enriched for centrosomal and cilia proteins. Deletion patient-derived NPCs show increased primary cilium length compared to unaffected individuals, while stunted cilium growth was observed in 16p11.2 duplication NPCs. Through cellular shRNA and overexpression screens in human iPSC derived NPCs, we determined the contribution of genes within the 16p11.2 locus to cilium length. TAOK2, a serine threonine protein kinase, and PPP4C, a protein phosphatase, were found to regulate primary cilia length in a gene dosage-dependent manner. We found TAOK2 was localized at centrosomes and the base of the primary cilium, and NPCs differentiated from TAOK2 knockout iPSCs had longer cilia. In absence of TAOK2, there was increased pericentrin at the basal body, and aberrant accumulation of IFT88 at the ciliary distal tip. Further, pharmacological inhibition of TAO kinase activity led to increased ciliary length, indicating that TAOK2 negatively controls primary cilium length through its catalytic activity. These results implicate aberrant cilia length in the pathophysiology of 16p11.2 CNV, and establish the role of TAOK2 kinase as a regulator of primary cilium length.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.617021", "title": "Local cortical inhibitory subnetworks are shaped by pyramidal neuron progenitor type", "authors": "Gothard, G.; Mahfooz, K.; Newey, S.

We measured VTA dopamine and GABA population activity while male and female rats learned to associate three discrete auditory cues to three distinct outcomes: reward, punishment, or no outcome within the same session. After learning, the reward and punishment cue-outcome contingencies were reversed, and subsequently re-reversed. As expected, the dopamine population rapidly adapted to learning and contingency reversals by increasing the response to appetitive stimuli and decreasing the response to aversive stimuli. In contrast, the GABA population increased activity to all sensory events regardless of valence, including the neutral cue. Reversing learned contingencies selectively influenced GABA responses to the reward-predictive cue, prolonging increased activity within and across sessions.

The striatum is comprised largely of GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that are defined by their long-range efferents. Direct SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal globus pallidus/substantia nigra reticulata whereas indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum; the concerted activity of both SPN subtypes modulates movement. Convergent results from genetic, imaging and physiological studies in patients suggest that abnormalities of both dSPNs and iSPNs contribute to the expression of dystonia, but the molecular adaptations underlying these abnormalities are not known. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of SPN cell-type specific molecular signatures in a model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD mice), which is caused by gene defects that reduce dopamine neurotransmission, resulting in dystonia that is specifically associated with striatal dysfunction. Individually profiling the translatome of dSPNs and iSPNs using translating ribosome affinity purification with RNA-seq revealed hundreds of differentially translating mRNAs in each SPN subtype in DRD mice, yet there was little overlap between the dysregulated genes in dSPNs and iSPNs. Despite the paucity of shared adaptations, a disruption in glutamatergic signaling was predicted for both dSPNs and iSPNs. Indeed, we found that both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents were enhanced in dSPNs but diminished in iSPNs in DRD mice. The pattern of mRNA dysregulation was specific to dystonia as the adaptations in DRD mice were distinct from those in parkinsonian mice where the dopamine deficit occurs in adults, suggesting that the phenotypic outcome is dependent on both the timing of the dopaminergic deficit and the SPN-specific adaptions. We leveraged the unique molecular signatures of dSPNs and iSPNs in DRD mice to identify biochemical mechanisms that may be targets for therapeutics, including LRRK2 inhibition. Administration of the LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2 ameliorated the dystonia in DRD mice suggesting a novel target for therapeutics and demonstrating that the delineation of cell-type specific molecular signatures provides a powerful approach to revealing both CNS dysfunction and therapeutic targets in dystonia.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.617007", "title": "Electrical diversity of neurons in sensory cortices", "authors": "Calcini, N.; Zeldenrust, F.; Celikel, T.", "author_corresponding": "Tansu Celikel", "author_corresponding_institution": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "date": "2024-10-07", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_by_nc_nd", "category": "neuroscience", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/07/2024.10.07.617007.source.xml", "abstract": "The classification of neuronal types is a complex task with numerous molecular, anatomical, and functional (electrical) features have been identified as informative in discriminating neuronal populations.

Upon dephosphorylation, BAF dimers cross-bridge chromosomes and bind lamins and transmembrane proteins of the reassembling nuclear envelope. How Ankle2 functions in mitosis is incompletely understood. Using a combination of approaches in Drosophila, along with structural modeling, we show for the first time that Ankle2 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A, explaining how it promotes BAF dephosphorylation.

We conducted a transcriptomic analysis on hydroponically and soil grown Medicago truncatula plants to investigate gene expression responses to Cd and Hg exposure in roots, leaves, and nodules. By using plant genotypes with varying metal tolerance or accumulation levels, we observed distinct clustering of gene ontologies, indicating tissue-specific, genotype-specific, and metal-specific gene expression patterns. Considering the symbiotic relationship between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, we further examined plant phenotypes and transcriptomes of plant genotypes with contrasting Hg accumulation levels and inoculated them with high or low Hg-tolerant Sinorhizobium medicae strains that have presence-absence variation for a mercury reductase (Mer) operon. Host plants inoculated with the Hg-tolerant rhizobia strain possessing a Mer operon exhibited less reduction in nodule number and plant biomass. A smaller reduction in iron (Fe) distribution in nodules after Hg stress was measured using X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) imaging. Dual transcriptome (host plant and bacteria) analysis of nodules revealed a remarkable decrease in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and clustering of gene ontologies in plants inoculated with the Hg-tolerant rhizobia strain, including symbiosis related genes. This suggests the Hg-tolerant rhizobia strain has the potential to mitigate Hg stress in host plants. Furthermore, we observed genotype-by-genotype interactions between the high Hg accumulating plant genotype and the Hg-tolerant rhizobia strain. These findings provide insights into enhancing plant resilience in contaminated environments through optimizing legume-rhizobia interactions for heavy metal tolerance, as well as identification of genetic mechanisms that can reduce transport to edible plant parts.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.616969", "title": "Predicting near-future deforestation in West African Key Biodiversity Areas to inform conservation urgency", "authors": "Trew, B.

We find that (i) KBAs in the Guinean Forests have lost over 265,000 hectares of forest cover over the past decade, with those in Cote d'Ivoire experiencing the highest forest loss; (ii) future deforestation risk is highest among KBAs in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire (on average 10% predicted loss across KBAs), where some are predicted to lose over a fifth of remaining forest cover by 2033. Models indicate that deforestation is highly contagious, with historical forest loss effectively predicting further adjacent loss, and that forest fragmentation and ease of human access also increased the localised deforestation risk. Conversely, predicted forest loss was lower in sites under some form of conservation protection. Our methods to predict near-future hotspots of deforestation risk in KBAs are reproducible and therefore applicable to other biodiversity hotspots.

In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis using island-specific species richness values for approximately one hundred ROAs across major oceanic archipelagos (mostly Hawaii, Canary Islands, Galapagos and Fiji) and taxa (vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). Our aim was to determine whether (1) ROA species richness patterns scale as a function of key geo-environmental factors including island area, geological age, environmental heterogeneity (elevation and topographic complexity) and inter-island isolation, and (2) whether the magnitude of the effects of these factors varies across archipelagos and taxa. Our results identified elevation as a key driver of ROA species richness patterns on islands, supporting existing theoretical and empirical work that highlighted the central role of environmental heterogeneity in driving diversification on oceanic islands. As importantly, we found that the influence of geo-environmental factors varies across archipelagos and taxa, suggesting that unique archipelagic dynamics and biological traits together shape diversification differently.

Although there are reports about noteworthy occurrences of alien plant species in garden centres, this phenomenon has hardly been studied systematically. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted systematic field surveys in 12 garden centres in Hungary to assess their alien flora. We hypothesised that (i) the number of alien species inhabiting a garden centre is positively correlated with its size, (ii) relative to their size, garden centres host a disproportionately large proportion of the local alien flora, and (iii) alien species inhabiting garden centres differ from the regional alien flora in their traits. We recorded altogether 93,788 individuals of 67 introduced species, seven of which have not yet been reported from the country. There was considerable variability in the number of species and individuals found in each garden centre, but there was no correlation between the size of the garden centres and the number of species they host. Despite their relatively small size, the studied garden centres hosted a considerable proportion of the local alien flora, indicating that they strongly accumulate alien species and that they can act as invasion hubs for several alien species. Alien species inhabiting garden centres differed from the regional alien flora in some of their trait values, indicating that the species that are most successful at establishing populations inside garden centres are both good dispersers and possess an effective resource-acquisitive strategy. We conclude that established alien plant populations in garden centres may induce local invasions, and in the meantime, individuals and seeds inside the containers of ornamental plants are regularly transported to distant areas by the customers. Therefore, plant species dispersed as contaminants of horticultural stock need to be better considered in invasion biology to reduce the threat they may present.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.05.616821", "title": "Transcriptional Responses and Microbiome Shifts in Pea Roots Under High pH Stress", "authors": "Thapa, A.; Hasan, M.

In this study, high pH in soil caused stunted growth and biomass reduction, accompanied by impaired photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis. We observed shifts in key nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including Rhizobium indicum, R. leguminosarum, and R. redzepovicii, in nodules under high pH, highlighting the importance of micronutrient balance in legume-microbe symbiosis. This was accompanied by the downregulation of NifA and NifD genes, though NifH upregulation suggests a compensatory response to maintain nitrogenase activity. RNA-seq analysis unveiled extensive transcriptional reprogramming, with upregulation of genes associated with oxidative stress response (oxidoreductase activity, Psat1g015240; glutathione transferase activity, Psat1g010280), metal ion transport (Psat1g011640), and downregulation of ammonia-lyase activity (Psat1g046920) and ion binding (Psat1g040440, Psat5g094200) genes suggests broader changes in nutrient balance and homeostasis under high pH conditions. KEGG pathway analysis revealed metabolic constraints and potential disruptions in stress signaling pathways, such as the MAPK signaling pathway. Amplicon sequencing analysis reveals significant shifts in the diversity and abundance of root-associated bacterial communities in response to high pH. We observed the enrichment of Variovorax, Shinella, and Methylophilus in the roots, suggesting their potential recruitment by host determinants in response to high pH. This increase in siderophore production suggests a microbial strategy to cope with micronutrient imbalance in high pH. Additionally, stable genera such as Pseudomonas, Novosphinogobium, Mycobacterium, and Herbaspirillum indicate resilience to soil alkalinity, potentially serving as key components of the core microbiome in adapting to high pH envFements.

Using coarse-grained polymer simulations, we uncovered the role of lamin-lamin, lamin-membrane and lamin-chromatin interactions in maintaining wild-type lamin and chromatin organisation and showed that disruptions in these interactions can reproduce the experimental observations in the lamin mutants. These predictions were verified using 3D-FISH experiments to quantify the reorganisation of chromosome territories in these mutants. Using advanced imaging methods, we characterised the dynamical properties of the lamin aggregates in the mutants to show for the first time a liquid-like state of the lamin aggregates through a liquid-liquid phase separation. The altered lamin and chromatin interactions in the mutants thus manifest as liquid-like aggregates in the nucleoplasm leading to disruption of the spatial organisation of the genome in these laminopathy-associated mutants.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.616982", "title": "Estimating the effective population size across space and time in the Critically Endangered western chimpanzee in Guinea-Bissau: challenges and implications for conservation management", "authors": "Ferreira da Silva, M.

We also aim to integrate the different Ne estimates to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history and current demography of this great ape and to discuss strengths and limitations of each estimator and their complementarity in informing conservation decisions. Results from the PSMC method suggest a large ancestral Ne, likely due to ancient structure over the whole subspecies distribution until approximately 10-15,000 years ago. After that, a change in connectivity, a real decrease in size or a combination of both occurred, which reduced the then still large ancestral population to a smaller size (MSVAR: ~10,000 decreasing to 1,000-6,000 individuals), possibly indicating a fragmentation into coastal and inner subpopulations.

Consequently, the efficacy of inhibitory/excitatory synapses profoundly affects neural network processing and overall neuronal functions. Here, we describe a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced at cortical inhibitory synapses and its behavioral consequences. We show that high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) of GABAergic neurons elicit inhibitory LTP (i-LTP) in pyramidal neurons of the auditory cortex (AC). The selective activation of cholecystokinin-expressing GABA (GABACCK) neurons is essential for the formation of HFLS-induced i-LTP, rather than the classical parvalbumin (PV) neurons and somatostatin (SST) neurons. Intriguingly, i-LTP can be evoked in the AC by adding the exogenous neuropeptide CCK when PV neurons and SST neurons are selectively activated in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respectively. Additionally, we discovered that low-frequency laser stimulation (LFLS) of PV neurons paired with HFLS of GABACCK neurons potentiates the inhibitory effect of PV interneurons on pyramidal neurons, thereby generating heterosynaptic i-LTP in the AC.

We probed the robustness of this finding by asking if humans can selectively attenuate adaptation based on the task-relevance of error signals. Subjects made planar reaches to three different targets: an arc (Experiment 1), a bar (Experiment 2), and a point (Experiment 3). During the reach, perturbations in extent (visuomotor gain), direction (visuomotor rotation) or both simultaneously were employed. In Experiment 1, subjects showed robust adaptation to the rotation when reaching to the arc even though the presence of this perturbation was irrelevant for achievement of the task goal. Interestingly however, rotation adaptation was strongly attenuated when it was presented simultaneously with a task-relevant gain perturbation. In Experiment 2, which involved reaches to the bar, again, subjects successfully adapted to the task-irrelevant gain perturbation when it occurred in isolation. However, adaptation was attenuated when the gain co-occurred with a task-relevant rotation. Experiment 3 revealed that the attenuation observed in the first two experiments was not due to an inability to adapt to co-occurring rotation and gain perturbations. Collectively, our results suggest that the sensorimotor system selectively tunes learning in the presence of multiple error signals, a finding that can potentially be explained by a biased competition mechanism. That is, given limited processing capacity, a salient attribute - the relevance of the error to the task goal in this case - is prioritized for processing and drives subsequent adaptive changes in motor output.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.617131", "title": "Genetically-encoded markers for confocal visualization of single dense core vesicles", "authors": "Yu, J.; Zhang, Y.; Clements, K.; Chen, N.; Griffith, L.

Although the BNF response to temperature may crucially impact future ecosystem productivity in the face of global climate change, little is known about Hsp expression in nodules of N-fixing non-agricultural species, such as tropical N-fixing trees in the Fabaceae family. This project aimed to characterize small (15-20 kDa) Hsp (sHsp) expression in nodule tissue to examine the biochemical mechanisms of heat response in these tissues. To first identify Hsps in nodule tissues, Vachellia farnesiana and Acacia confusa nodules were excised, heat shock was induced, and protein content was isolated via chemical treatment before separation of protein species and analysis with SDS-PAGE. Two polyacrylamide gels yielded bands in the 15-20 kDa region that displayed differential Coomassie staining, which were sent for further characterization by HPLC-MS analysis for protein sequencing. Ten rhizobial sHsps were detected in these samples in addition to seven Acacia sHsps when compared independently to reference rhizobial and plant proteome databases. In an attempt quantify relative expression of Hsps in nodule and root tissue, we performed western blot experiments using Anti-Hsp20 antibodies raised against human and mouse Hsp proteins, with anti-beta actin loading control. While nonuniform beta-actin expression across tissue types (A. confusa nodules versus root control) prevented quantitative analysis, the experiments validated that Hsp20s are expressed in Acacia nodules as well as in root tissue.

We utilized well-annotated rapid autopsy-derived tumors to develop xenograft models that mimic key features of SCLC, including histopathology, rapid and widespread development of metastasis to the liver, brain, adrenal, bone marrow, and kidneys within weeks, and response to chemotherapy.

Human liver metastases exhibited reduced LMNA expression compared to other metastatic sites, correlating with poorer patient outcomes and increased mortality.

In this work, we design and validate a plasmid set, the pXpressome toolkit, in which alpha carboxysomes are robustly expressed and remain intact and functional after purification. We tested this toolkit by introducing mutations which influence carboxysome structure and performance. We find that deletion of vertex-capping genes results in formation of larger carboxysomes while deletion of facet forming genes produces smaller particles, suggesting that adjusting the ratio of these proteins can rationally affect morphology.

However, this function does not explain how bacterial cells partition the rest (bulk) of the chromosomal material. Furthermore, some bacteria, including Escherichia coli, lack a ParABS system. Yet, E. coli faithfully segregates nucleoids across various growth rates. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that polysome production during chromosomal gene expression helps compact, split, segregate, and position nucleoids in E. coli through phase separation, inherently coupling these processes to biomass growth across nutritional conditions. Halting polysome formation immediately stops sister nucleoid migration while ensuing polysome depletion gradually reverses nucleoid segregation. Redirecting gene expression away from the chromosome and toward plasmids arrests nucleoid segregation and causes ectopic polysome accumulations that drive aberrant nucleoid dynamics.

First, environmental temperature predicted geographic variation in fly microbial communities better than latitude did. The microbiota also differed between wild flies and their diets, supporting previous conclusions that the fly microbiota is not merely a reflection of diet. Flies feeding on different diets varied significantly in their microbiota composition, and flies sampled from individual apples were exceptionally depauperate for the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), a major bacterial group in wild and laboratory flies. However, flies bore significantly more LAB when sampled from other fruits or compost piles. Follow-up analyses revealed that LAB abundance in the flies uniquely responds to fruit decomposition, whereas other microbiota members better indicate temporal seasonal progression. Finally, we show that diet-dependent variation in the fly microbiota is associated with phenotypic differentiation of fly lines collected in a single orchard.

Unlike other drugs, PZA action is conditional and requires potentiation by host-relevant environmental stressors, such as low pH and nutrient limitation. Despite its pivotal role in tuberculosis therapy, the mechanistic basis for PZA potentiation remains unknown and the durability of this crucial drug is challenged by the emergent spread of drug resistance. To advance our understanding of PZA action and facilitate discovery efforts, we characterized the activity of a more potent PZA analog, morphazinamide (MZA). Here, we demonstrate that like PZA, MZA acts in part through impairment of coenzyme A synthesis. Unexpectedly, we find that, in contrast to PZA, MZA does not require potentiation due to aldehyde-mediated disruption of thiol metabolism and maintains bactericidal activity against PZA-resistant strains. Our findings reveal a novel dual action mechanism of MZA that synergistically disrupts coenzyme A synthesis resulting in a faster rate of killing and a higher barrier to resistance relative to PZA. Together, these observations resolve the mechanistic basis for potentiation of a key first-line antitubercular drug and provide new insights for discovery of improved therapeutic approaches for tuberculosis.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.08.617232", "title": "Functional Phenotyping of MMV Pandemic Response Box Identifies Stage-specific inhibitors Against Blood stage Plasmodium", "authors": "Chandramohanadas, R.; TP, A.; KM, D.", "author_corresponding": "Rajesh Chandramohanadas", "author_corresponding_institution": "Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology", "date": "2024-10-08", "version": "1", "type": "new results", "license": "cc_no", "category": "microbiology", "jatsxml": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/08/2024.10.08.617232.source.xml", "abstract": "Wide-spread resistance to clinically used antimalarials necessitates the prioritization of novel scaffolds with alternate mechanisms, as possible partner drugs to artemisinin.

Here, we studied the molecular and physiological responses of crayfish when experimentally exposed to a pesticide mix of azoxystrobin and oxadiazon at sublethal concentrations. We compared these responses in three isolated crayfish populations in Southern France that are established in areas with different pollution levels: i) Camargue, seasonally affected by pesticide pollution; ii) Bages-Sigean, impacted all year-round by domestic effluents and; iii) Salagou, a more pristine site. Gene expression analyses revealed that the response to the pesticide mix was the strongest in the Camargue crayfish. In this population, a total of 88 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in hepatopancreas and 78 in gills between exposed and control laboratory groups. Among genes that were differentially expressed and successfully annotated, those involved in stress, DNA repair, immune response, and translation and transcription processes stand out. Interestingly, the hepatopancreas responded mainly with upregulation, but with downregulation in the gills.

While traditionally viewed as a waste product, lactate is an important energy source for many organs, but first must be oxidized to pyruvate for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). This reaction is thought to occur in the cytosol, with pyruvate subsequently transported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Using 13C stable isotope tracing, we demonstrated that lactate is oxidized in the myocardial tissue of mice even when the MPC is genetically deleted. This MPC-independent lactate import and mitochondrial oxidation is dependent upon the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1/Slc16a1). Mitochondria isolated from the myocardium without MCT1 exhibit a specific defect in mitochondrial lactate, but not pyruvate, metabolism. The import and subsequent mitochondrial oxidation of lactate by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) acts as an electron shuttle, generating sufficient NADH to support respiration even when the TCA cycle is disrupted. In response to diverse cardiac insults, animals with hearts lacking MCT1 undergo rapid progression to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Thus, the mitochondrial import and oxidation of lactate enables carbohydrate entry into the TCA cycle to sustain cardiac energetics and maintain myocardial structure and function under stress conditions.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.08.617274", "title": "Integrating N-glycan and CODEX imaging reveal cell-specific protein glycosylation in healthy human lung", "authors": "Velickovic, D.; Purkerson, J.; Bhotika, H.; Huyck, H.; Clair, G.

Identifying cell-specific N-glycan structures in human lungs is critical for understanding the chemistry and mechanisms that guide cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and determining nuanced functions of specific N-glycosylation. Our study, which used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) combined with co-detection by indexing (CODEX) to reveal the cellular origin of N-glycans, is a significant step in this direction. This innovative technological combination enabled us to detect and differentiate N-glycans located in the vicinity of cells surrounding airways and blood vessels, parenchyma, submucosal glands, cartilage, and smooth muscles. The potential impact of our findings on future research is immense. For instance, our algorithm for grouping N-glycans based on their functional chemical features, combined with identifying group niches, paves the way for targeted studies. We found that fucosylated N-glycans are dominant around immune cells, tetra antennary N-glycans in the cartilage, high-mannose N-glycans surrounding the bronchus originate from associated collagenous structures, complex fucosylated-tetra antennary-polylactosamine N-glycans are spread over smooth muscle structures and in epithelial cells surrounding arteries, and N-glycans with Hex:6 HexNAc:6 compositions, which, according to our algorithm, can be ascribed to either tetra antennary or bisecting N-glycan, are highly abundant in the parenchyma. The findings suggest cell or region-specific functions for these localized glycan structures.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.08.617299", "title": "Leveraging HILIC/ERLIC Separations for Online Nanoscale LC- MS/MS Analysis of Phosphopeptide Isoforms from RNA Polymerase II C-terminal Domain", "authors": "Ficarro, S.

The largest Pol II subunit, Rpb1, has a C-terminal domain (CTD) comprising dozens of repeated heptad sequences (Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7), each containing five phospho-accepting amino acids. The CTD heptads are dynamically phosphorylated, creating specific patterns correlated with steps of transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. This CTD phosphorylation \"code\" choreographs dynamic recruitment of important co-regulatory proteins during gene transcription. Genetic tools were used to engineer protease cleavage sites across the CTD (msCTD), creating tryptic peptides with unique sequences amenable to mass spectrometry analysis. However, phosphorylation isoforms within each msCTD sequence are difficult to resolve by standard reversed phase chromatography typically used for LC-MS/MS applications. Here, we use a panel of synthetic CTD phosphopeptides to explore the potential of hydrophilic interaction and electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction (HILIC and ERLIC) chromatography as alternatives to reversed phase separation for CTD phosphopeptide analysis. Our results demonstrate that ERLIC provides improved performance for separation of singly- and doubly-phosphorylated CTD peptides for sequence analysis by LC-MS/MS. Analysis of native yeast msCTD confirms that phosphorylation on Ser5 and Ser2 represents the major endogenous phosphoisoforms.

Development of better variants of omega-TAs are hence essential for their industrial uses. We have studied the active site architecture of the wild-type omega-TAs, to develop engineered enzymes for enhancing the biotransformation of (R)-Phenylacetylcarbinol to (1R, 2S)-Norephedrine. Two such omega-TAs (TA_5182 and TA_2799) from P. putida KT2440 strain were overexpressed and purified as recombinant proteins. Crystal structures of TA_5182 were solved in two conformations, and significant movements of two highly flexible loops were observed in these different states. The TA_2799 structure was determined in the co-factor bound state with a PLP molecule covalently bonded to the catalytic K286 as an internal aldimine. Enzyme assays indicated that TA_2799 required significantly higher concentrations of co-factor than TA_5182 to achieve satisfactory biotransformation of (R)-PAC. A key mutation of L322F in TA_2799 drastically reduced the co-factor dependency of the TA_2799_L322F mutant enzyme, and the mutant remained active for 96h at 30 degrees C. The crystal structure of the mutant enzyme revealed an asparagine residue that mediates a hydrogen bonding network at the dimeric interface of the enzyme and is absent in TA_5182. The TA_5182_G119N mutant also showed enhanced co-factor affinity.

Do these proteins suffer progressive changes in conformations and interactions in pathologic situations? In-cell NMR provides atomic-scale information in live cells but, until now, only at ~283 K in the case of unfolded proteins. Here, we report new labeling and acquisition methods enabling in-cell NMR at 310 K to study these proteins at micromolar concentrations, i.e. native cellular abundances. We used stable human cell lines expressing -synuclein or tau upon induction in a culture medium supplemented with 13C-labeled amino acids, or precursors thereof. Acquiring 13C-13CO spectra permitted an early residue-resolved analysis of -synuclein and tau at 310 K and <10 M in HEK cells at 700 MHz. We detected disordered conformations and identical patterns of cellular interactions for -synuclein wild-type and two mutants (F4A, A30P). Only the disordered N-terminus of tau was observable, even upon microtubule dismantling by colchicin. Our approach offers an excellent scalability -in signal and resolution- up to 1.2 GHz. 13C-labeling and 13C-detected NMR in live human cells are thus viable techniques for in-cell structural biology.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.08.617196", "title": "Enhancement of Enzymatic Activity by Biomolecular Condensates through pH Buffering", "authors": "Stoffel, F.; Papp, M.; Ku\u0308ffner, A.

Since protein conformations can differ between the dense and dilute phase, phase separation can particularly modulate enzymes characterized by a conformation-dependent activity. Here, we generate enzymatic condensates based on a lipase from Bacillus thermocatenulatus, which exhibits an equilibrium between a closed, inactive state, and an open, active conformation. We show that the activity of the enzyme increases inside the dense phase, leading to an enhancement of the overall reaction rate in the phase-separated system. Moreover, we demonstrate that these condensates can generate a more basic environment compared to the surrounding solution. As a consequence, the phase-separated system maintains a high enzymatic activity even in acidic conditions that would be otherwise less favourable for the lipase. We further show that the formation of two phases with distinct pH values optimizes a cascade reaction involving two enzymes with different optimal pH conditions. Our results demonstrate that biomolecular condensates can also affect the dependence of enzymatic rates on solution pH, thereby expanding the accessible pH interval and enabling network reactions with enzymes that require distinct pH values.

Current therapies show limited success, highlighting the urgent need for novel interventions. Recent advances in cancer vaccine research show great promise in reducing disease recurrence, but these approaches still face challenges pertaining to antigen selection, ease of production, and programmability. To address some of these challenges, we have adapted the DoriVac platform to serve as a cancer vaccine against metastatic melanoma. DoriVac is a DNA origami-based vaccine platform that allows for the codelivery of antigens of choice and the CpG immune adjuvant at an optimal nanospacing to promote Th1 immune polarization. In our study, we observed a significant reduction in lung tumor nodules for mice treated with DoriVac in both the B16OVA and B16F10 melanoma mouse models. DoriVac also appears to be a safe and effective treatment, with no anti-drug antibodies, as indicated by lower anti-dsDNA levels. Importantly, we observed an amplified effect when DoriVac was combined with PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade, leading to an even greater reduction in metastatic lung tumor nodules. Our results also indicate an increased activation of antigen presenting cells, NK cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that DoriVac, particularly in combination with the PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade, can serve as a promising immunotherapy against metastatic cancer.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}, {"doi": "10.1101/2024.10.07.617011", "title": "Pseudohypoxia-stabilized HIF2\u03b1 transcriptionally inhibits MNRR1, a druggable target in MELAS", "authors": "Purandare, N.; Pasupathi, V.; Xi, Y.; Rajan, V.; Vegh, C.; Firestine, S.; Kozicz, T.; Fribley, A.

High throughput screening of a 2400 compound drug and natural products library uncovered the antifungal drug nitazoxanide and its metabolite tizoxanide as effective enhancers of MNRR1 transcription. Using the mitochondrial disease MELAS (in which various mixtures, called heteroplasmy, of wild-type and mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) coexist) as a test, we showed that treating a cybrid MELAS model with tizoxanide could restore cellular respiration, enhance mitophagy, and, importantly, shift heteroplasmy toward more wildtype mtDNA. Furthermore, in MELAS patient fibroblasts, the compound could improve mitochondrial biogenesis, enhance autophagy, and protect the fibroblasts from LPS-induced inflammation. Chemical activation of MNRR1 is thus a potential strategy to improve mitochondrial deficits seen in MELAS. Investigation of the mechanism by which MNRR1 is reduced identified that two factors compete to regulate transcription at the MNRR1 promoter - RBPJk, which stimulates it, and HIF2, which inhibits it. In MELAS cells there is a pseudohypoxic state that stabilizes HIF2, leading to transcriptional inhibition of MNRR1. Nitazoxanide reduces the levels of HIF2 by increasing the levels of PHD3, the prolyl hydroxylase that degrades HIF2.", "published": "NA", "server": "biorxiv"}]}
